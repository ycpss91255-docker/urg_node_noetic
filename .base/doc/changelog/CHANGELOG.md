## [Unreleased]

## [v0.41.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **`justfile` user-facing entry point, additive alongside the Makefile (#545, ADR-00000005 phase 1)** — new `script/docker/justfile` (symlinked from the downstream repo root as `justfile` by `init.sh`) provides `just <verb>` recipes (`build` / `run` / `start` / `exec` / `stop` / `prune` / `setup` / `setup-tui` / `upgrade` / `upgrade-check`) that forward 1:1 to `./script/<wrapper>.sh` with full `{{args}}` passthrough. Because `just` does not treat `VAR=VALUE` as overrides or consume `--`/`-flag` argv for itself, the make-era workarounds (`MAKEOVERRIDES` guard #414, mandatory `--` separator #448, `EXEC_ARGS` shim #469) are simply unnecessary: `just exec -t cli --/app/k=v` passes through verbatim. Bare `just` runs `just --list` (replaces `make help`). This is the **additive** phase -- the Makefile stays; its retirement + the downstream fanout is #546. `Makefile.ci` is unrelated and stays on make. Closes #545. Refs ADR-00000005, #475.
- **TUI runtime-env (`.env`) info page (#497 acceptance: TUI points at the `.env` overlay)** — `setup_tui.sh`'s Runtime sub-menu gains a `workload env (.env)` entry whose page is **informational only**: it explains the #502 two-role split -- volatile per-task env vars (ROS_DOMAIN_ID, LOG_LEVEL, tokens) go in the hand-edited, gitignored `.env` overlay (taking effect with `make run` alone, no regenerate / no hash drift), while set-once defaults live in `[environment]` (baked as image `ENV`, emitted into compose, overridden by `.env` at runtime). Per the S2 (#502) invariant that `setup.sh` / the TUI never write `.env`, this is a guidance msgbox, not an editor. i18n in all four locales (en / zh-TW / zh-CN / ja). Refs #497, #502 (does not close #497 -- the remaining acceptance item is the 17-repo downstream migration tracked separately).
- **TUI legacy `runtime` -> `gpu_runtime` migration prompt (#517, fast-follow of #481)** — `setup_tui.sh`'s deploy page now detects when the per-repo `setup.conf` still carries the legacy `[deploy] runtime` key (and no `gpu_runtime`) and surfaces a migration suggestion msgbox -- it never silently rewrites the user's `setup.conf`. The deploy page reads the runtime value honouring both keys (gpu_runtime preferred, legacy `runtime` as fallback for the radiolist pre-selection) and writes the canonical `gpu_runtime` key on save, so editing via the TUI migrates the config forward; the user then removes the old line themselves. The per-stage scalar override prompt text now says `gpu_runtime (legacy runtime)` instead of `runtime`. i18n in all four locales (en / zh-TW / zh-CN / ja). Closes #517. Refs #481.
- **`[lifecycle]` restart TUI page (#514, fast-follow of #478)** — `setup_tui.sh` gains a Lifecycle page (under the Runtime sub-menu) for the `[lifecycle] restart` policy added by #478. A radiolist picks `no` / `always` / `unless-stopped` / `on-failure`; choosing `on-failure` adds a two-step optional integer retry count (>= 1; empty falls back to bare `on-failure`, assembling `on-failure:N`). Reuses `_validate_restart` from `lib/_tui_conf.sh`. i18n in all four locales (en / zh-TW / zh-CN / ja), including the value descriptions and the `always` / `unless-stopped` infinite-restart caveat (a stage that extends devel and exits 0 would loop). The feature was already usable via `setup.sh set lifecycle.restart` / editing `setup.conf`; this closes the interactive gap. Closes #514. Refs #478.
- **`lint_mixed_test_layout.sh` -- advisory lint for mixed-runner test layout (#495)** — new `script/ci/lint_mixed_test_layout.sh` warns when a `test/<category>/` directory holds files from more than one test runner at the same level (e.g. `.bats` + `test_*.py`), suggesting the `test/<category>/<tool>/` subdir split that ADR-00000004 (#473) defines. WARNING-only and non-blocking (it always exits 0): a mixed state is sometimes a legitimate mid-migration intermediate, so it surfaces the drift via `_log_warn` without failing CI. Wired into `ci.sh`'s `_run_shellcheck` lint phase (so it runs on the local `make test` path and the dedicated `--shellcheck-only` GHA job) and shellchecked itself. Downstream repos inherit the guard via the `.base/` subtree. Closes #495.
- **`ci.sh --bats-path <file|dir>` + `--filter <regex>` single-path test mode (#523)** — the test engine gains a fast TDD inner loop: `--bats-path` runs one spec FILE or DIRECTORY (repo-root-relative, resolved inside the `ci` container) and `--filter` passes a `bats -f` name filter (usable with or without `--bats-path`). Both run via the `ci` container reusing the existing env plumbing (`BATS_FILE` / `BATS_FILTER` / `BATS_ONLY=1`), skipping ShellCheck (covered by `--shellcheck-only` / full `test`) and kcov so iterating on one spec no longer forces the whole `test/unit/` + `test/integration/` suite. Guards: a path under `test/behavioural/` exits with a hint to use `make test-behavioural` (the host `ci.sh` cannot launch the `ci-behavioural` service); a non-existent path exits `ci_bats_path_not_found`; `--bats-path` + `--coverage` is rejected (single-path is the fast no-kcov loop). `Makefile.ci` stays a thin forwarder and is out of scope (#475). Closes #523.
- **Per-stage `[security]` cap_add / cap_drop / security_opt overrides (#526)** — the per-stage `[stage:<name>]` override allowlist (`_validate_stage_override_key`) is extended to `security.cap_add_<N>`, `security.cap_drop_<N>`, `security.security_opt_<N>` plus the matching `*_inherit` toggles, resolved through the same `_resolve_docker_flags` list layer as `volumes` / `ports` / `environment` (append-by-default; `<list>_inherit = false` replaces/clears). This lets a downstream drop capabilities / `security_opt` for individual stages instead of only image-wide: e.g. `ycpss91255-docker/jetson_sdk_manager` keeps `SYS_ADMIN` + `seccomp:unconfined` on its `flash` stage but a read-only `probe` stage sets `security.cap_add_inherit = false` (+ `security_opt_inherit = false`) to run with zero inherited caps -- minimal blast radius for stages that never flash. Both renderers consume the effective per-stage lists: the compose standalone block (`_emit_caps_block` now takes the resolved lists) and the field `deploy.sh` generator (`_generate_deploy_sh`). Stages with no `[stage:*]` security override inherit the top-level `[security]` block byte-identically (compose output unchanged for existing repos). This is the `[security]` half of the v1 "Excluded by design" note; the global caps opt-in (#466) and per-stage mechanism (#220) are unchanged. Closes #526. Refs #466, #493, #505.
- **`setup.sh deploy` -- one-command self-contained field bundle (S6d of #497, completes the #506 deploy generator)** — new subcommand that builds the immutable field image and writes the `tar.xz` bundle for a stage (default `runtime`): it previews the resolved field launcher (every inlined docker-level flag -- the per-parameter review), prompts for confirmation, then runs `_generate_deploy_bundle` (S6c). `--dry-run` prints the build plan without building (and skips the prompt); `-y` skips the prompt; a non-interactive shell without `-y` refuses (mirrors `reset`); `--stage <name>` picks the target stage and `--output <file>` the bundle path (default `<base>/deploy/<name>-<stage>.tar.xz`). Field flow: extract the bundle, `docker load < image.tar`, `./deploy.sh`. With S1-S6 this closes the ADR-00000003 delivery story -- channel 1 (baked image: ENV via S3 + structured config via S4) and the docker-level run flags travel; the dev-only `.env`/workspace bind do not. The graphical per-param TUI confirmation page (setup_tui.sh) is an optional fast-follow: the plain-text preview already surfaces every resolved flag and is script / CI friendly (the issue invited the lighter flow). The orchestrator invokes `docker build` / `docker save` directly (no `script/` wrapper exists for image build/save -- the wrappers cover compose run/build/exec/stop/prune). Closes #506. Refs #497, #498, #503, #504, #505.
- **`_generate_deploy_bundle` -- self-contained `tar.xz` field-bundle orchestrator (S6c of #497)** — new `setup.sh` helper that assembles the full field deliverable for a baked stage: resolves the image name + `[environment]`, bakes the env defaults as `ENV` via `_generate_runtime_dockerfile` (S3), `COPY`s `config/app` into the image via the new `_bake_config_copy` when the repo ships one (S4 deploy half), runs `docker build --target <stage>`, generates the launcher via `_generate_deploy_sh` (S6b-gen), `docker save`s the image, and `tar -cJf`s `{image.tar, deploy.sh}` into the bundle. Field flow: extract -> `docker load < image.tar` -> `./deploy.sh`. The generated Dockerfile + launcher are written under a temp dir (build context stays the repo via `docker build -f <tmp> <base>`, no repo side effect), and the docker / tar steps run through `_dry_run_cmd` so `DRY_RUN=true` prints the plan without building. This is the **deploy-only orchestrator**; the user-facing `setup.sh deploy` subcommand + per-param TUI confirmation are the remaining S6 follow-ups (S6d). Refs #497, #498, #503, #504, #505, #506.
- **`_generate_deploy_sh` -- self-contained `deploy.sh` field-launcher generator (S6b-gen of #497)** — new `setup.sh` helper that writes a runnable `docker run` launcher for a baked stage image by tying the three resolution layers together: `_resolve_deploy_context` (global conf, S6b) supplies the stage parent, `_resolve_docker_flags` (per-stage overrides, S5) computes the effective record for the chosen stage, and `_emit_docker_run_flags` (S6a) turns it into the `docker run` argv. The generated script is `chmod +x`, ShellCheck-clean, runs `docker run --detach --name <name> <flags> "${IMAGE}" "$@"`, and exposes `DEPLOY_IMAGE` / `DEPLOY_CONTAINER_NAME` overrides + trailing-arg passthrough. By design the launcher carries docker-level flags only: `[environment]` is omitted (baked into the image as `ENV` by S3) and bind volumes are omitted (they reference dev-host paths absent in the field; structured config is COPY-baked by S4) -- so the field image is self-contained. The global `[security] privileged` is honoured even when the stage does not override it (the field has no devel `${PRIVILEGED}` env layer). GPU enablement uses the generating host's detection, same as `apply`. This is the **deploy-only primitive** consumed by the S6 bundle orchestrator (S6c: `docker build --target <stage>` -> `docker save` -> `tar.xz {image, deploy.sh}`); it is not wired into `apply`. Refs #497, #498, #503, #504, #505, #506.
- **`_emit_docker_run_flags` -- docker-run flag-mapping primitive for the field launcher (S6a of #497)** — new `setup.sh` helper that maps a resolved docker-flag record (the `_resolve_docker_flags` S5 output, plus the top-level-only fields `devices` / `cap_add` / `cap_drop` / `security_opt` / `shm_size` / `dri_groups` / `cgroup_rules` / `restart`) into a `docker run` argv fragment for the self-contained `deploy.sh` field launcher (#506). The mapping mirrors the compose emit conditions exactly so the field run matches dev: `--gpus all` (or `count=N,capabilities=csv` when a count is set), `--runtime`, `--network=host|<name>`, `--ipc` (skipped for the `private` default), `--pid=host`, `--shm-size` (only when ipc != host), `--restart` (only when set & != no), `-v` per volume, `-p` per port (only under bridge), `--device` for plain devices and `-v` for propagation devices (mirroring #450), `--cap-add` / `--cap-drop` / `--security-opt`, `--group-add` per DRI gid, `--device-cgroup-rule`. `[environment]` is intentionally NOT mapped (it is baked into the image as `ENV` by S3, so the launcher carries only docker-level flags), and gui / X11 is out of scope (the field launcher targets headless run; GUI is a dev-only compose concern). This is the **deploy-only primitive** consumed by the S6 deploy generator (resolution glue + `docker save` + `tar.xz` bundle land in the S6 follow-ups); it is not wired into `apply`, so dev builds are unaffected. Refs #497, #498, #505.
- **`config/app/` structured app-config channel -- dev bind-mount (S4 of #497)** — when a repo ships a `config/app/` directory, `setup.sh apply` bind-mounts it into the dev container at `/opt/app/config` (emitted through the regular mount path, so per-stage `mount_inherit` and the #482 top-level-`volumes:` classifier treat it like any other `./` bind). This gives structured runtime config (e.g. ros1_bridge bridge-topic YAML, pipeline definitions) the edit-on-host + restart, no-rebuild dev loop -- the third routing channel from ADR-00000003, distinct from the flat `.env` overlay (which carries only `KEY=VALUE` env vars). Convention over configuration: the directory's presence is the only switch (no `setup.conf` knob). The deploy flow (S6, #506) COPY-bakes the same dir into the field image instead (immutable artifact). Refs #497, #498.
- **`_generate_runtime_dockerfile` -- runtime-stage `[environment]` ENV bake primitive (S3 of #497)** — new `setup.sh` helper that copies a repo `Dockerfile` to `.Dockerfile.generated`, splicing the resolved `[environment]` defaults as real `ENV KEY="VALUE"` instructions immediately after the `FROM ... AS runtime` line (cross-refs `${KEY}` expanded against earlier siblings, same as the compose `environment:` block). This is delivery channel 1 per ADR-00000003: a bare `docker run <runtime-image>` then carries sane defaults with no env file -- for the field-deployment scenario where only the image ships. The primitive is **deploy-only**: it is invoked by the deploy generator (S6, #506) at bundle time, NOT by `apply`. Day-to-day dev (`make run`) still gets `[environment]` via the compose `environment:` block + the `.env` overlay (S2), so dev builds are unaffected and produce no `.Dockerfile.generated`. Returns non-zero (no-op, writes nothing) when the Dockerfile has no `AS runtime` stage or `[environment]` is empty, so a repo without a runtime stage is untouched. Refs #497, #498.
- **`[stage:devel-test]` override surface for the `test` service (A1'-b)** — `devel-test` is promoted out of the baseline blocklist and now flows through the per-stage inherit-with-override model like any other non-baseline stage, while keeping the legacy service **name** `test` (so `./script/exec.sh -t test` and the `:test` image tag are unchanged); `build.target` stays `devel-test`. By default the `test` service `extends: devel` (previously a hardcoded bare block with no `deploy` / `environment` entry point, so no `setup.conf` knob could reach it); declaring `[stage:devel-test]` lets it diverge -- e.g. `deploy.gpu_mode = force` gives GPU-requiring runtime tests (the `ycpss91255-docker/isaac` Isaac Sim pytest case, ADR-0011) a GPU even when devel has none. Because the test service is now emitted from the `devel-test` stage, a Dockerfile must declare `FROM ... AS devel-test` for the service to appear (every template-based repo already does). Existing repos with no `[stage:devel-test]` gain the `extends: devel` shape on next regenerate (was a bare block); `_warn_config_drift` flags it at `make upgrade` time. Closes #493 (Bug A).
- **`[deploy] dri_groups` for non-NVIDIA (Intel/AMD iGPU) /dev/dri access** — `setup.sh` resolves the host's video + render GIDs (`stat -c %g /dev/dri/{card*,renderD*}`, deduped) at generation time and emits them as `group_add:` (numeric GIDs, quoted) on GUI-enabled services, so containers on iGPU hosts can open `/dev/dri/render*` for hardware GL (fixing the `libEGL ... renderD128: Permission denied` software-rendering fallback). `dri_groups = auto` (default) detects + emits; `off` disables; no `/dev/dri` -> emits nothing. GUI-gated (DRI is for GL rendering) and complements the NVIDIA `gpu_*` path. Numeric GIDs (the render GID varies per host, so names are non-portable) land in the gitignored generated `compose.yaml`; `setup.conf` stores only the portable `auto` token. Closes #496.
- **`[lifecycle] restart` policy** — `setup.conf` gains a `[lifecycle]` section with a `restart` key controlling `services.devel.restart:` (stages that `extends: devel` inherit it). Accepts the 5 docker policies `no` / `always` / `unless-stopped` / `on-failure` / `on-failure:N` (validated on `setup.sh set` and in the TUI validator). Default `no` emits no `restart:` field (compose unchanged for existing repos); `on-failure:N` is emitted quoted. Caveat documented in the section comment + README: `always` / `unless-stopped` restart on any exit, so a stage that extends devel and exits 0 (e.g. the `test` service after #493) would loop -- prefer `on-failure` for auto-retry. Set via `setup.sh set lifecycle.restart <policy>` or by editing `setup.conf`; an interactive TUI page is a fast-follow (#514). Closes #478.
- **Top-level `volumes:` declaration for named-volume mounts** — `setup.sh` now auto-emits a top-level `volumes:` block declaring every named volume that a service references, so a `setup.conf [volumes] mount_N = my_state:/srv/state` no longer fails compose with `service refers to undefined volume`. Option A (D-Strict): a mount's LHS is classified by prefix — `/`, `./`, `~/`, or `${` is a bind mount; anything else is a named volume. Named volumes are collected across devel + all stages, deduplicated, mode-suffix stripped, and emitted as bare stubs (default `local` driver) before `networks:`. Bind-only repos are byte-identical (no `volumes:` block emitted). Variable-named volumes (`${VAR}_state`) are intentionally unsupported (classified as bind; YAGNI per the design). Closes #482.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: the container-ops `Makefile` is retired in favour of `just` (#546, ADR-00000005 phase 2)** — `script/docker/Makefile` is removed; `init.sh` no longer symlinks a root `Makefile` and drops a stale one on upgrade (so it does not dangle once `.base/` ships no Makefile). The justfile (added in #545) is now the sole user-facing entry: `just build` / `run` / `exec` / `stop` / `prune` / `setup` / `setup-tui` / `upgrade` / `upgrade-check`. The make-era workarounds retire with the wrapper -- no more `MAKEOVERRIDES` guard (#414), mandatory `--` separator (#448), or `EXEC_ARGS` shim (#469); `just exec -t cli --/app/k=v` passes through verbatim. The test-tools image now ships `just` (+ a release smoke check) so the entry point keeps executable test coverage (`justfile_user_spec`, parity with the removed `makefile_user_spec`); those tests skip until the test-tools image is re-released with `just`. **`Makefile.ci` is unrelated and stays on make** (`make -f Makefile.ci test/lint` unchanged). Downstream migration (`make X` -> `just X`, install `just`, root-Makefile-symlink cleanup) rides the v0.41.0 fanout. README + i18n updated. Closes #546. Refs #475, #545, ADR-00000005, #414, #448, #469.
- **Global conf resolution extracted into a shared `_resolve_deploy_context` layer (S6b of #497)** — the docker/build scalar + list-string resolution that `_setup_apply` did inline (gpu family + legacy `runtime` alias, gui mode, network mode/ipc/pid/name, privileged, restart, dri groups, build network, and the aggregated `devices` / `cgroup_rule` / `env` / `tmpfs` / `ports` / `cap_add` / `cap_drop` / `security_opt` / `shm_size` strings with the #466 security template fallback) is pulled into one `setup.sh` helper, `_resolve_deploy_context <base_path> <out_assoc>`, that loads its own setup.conf sections and returns the record in an associative array. `apply` now calls it and unpacks the record into its existing locals; the deploy generator (S6b-gen) will feed the same record as the parent for the runtime stage, so the field deploy can never drift from what `apply` produces for the same `setup.conf`. This is the global counterpart to the per-stage `_resolve_docker_flags` (S5) and completes the #497 goal of a single flag-resolution layer feeding both compose and deploy. Kept apply-side (not moved): the `--gui` / `SETUP_GUI` override, the detection-dependent enabled booleans (callers run `_resolve_gpu` / `_resolve_gui` with their own host detection), the WS_PATH / `mount_1` migration, and the #450 device/volume validation warnings -- all dev-specific side effects. The one intrinsic side effect kept in the resolver is the legacy `[deploy] runtime` deprecation warning (#481). Pure internal refactor: compose.yaml output is **byte-identical** (the S5 golden master + the full `apply` bats suite stay green) and `apply` loads only the four sections it still consumes directly. Refs #497, #498, #505. Refs #506.
- **Per-stage docker-flag resolution consolidated into a single `_resolve_docker_flags` layer (S5 of #497)** — the inline block in `generate_compose_yaml`'s per-stage loop that resolved each stage's effective flags (gui / gpu / gpu_count / gpu_capabilities / gpu_runtime + legacy `runtime` alias / network mode-ipc-pid-name / privileged / volumes / environment / ports) via a dozen `_resolve_stage_scalar` + `_resolve_stage_list` calls is extracted into one `setup.sh` helper, `_resolve_docker_flags <stage_keys> <stage_values> <parent_assoc> <out_assoc>`. It takes a stage's allowlist-filtered `[stage:*]` overrides layered over the parent (devel / top-level) already-resolved values and returns the effective record in an associative array. Modes (gui / gpu) inherit the parent's resolved boolean unless the stage forces `off` / `force` -- no per-stage hardware re-detection (that host-specific step stays in the global resolution, upstream). The compose renderer now calls this single layer, and the deploy renderer (S6, #506) will call the same function for the `runtime` stage so the two never drift. Pure internal refactor: compose.yaml output is **byte-identical** (verified by a new full-file golden master exercising a `[stage:*]` override across every branch -- gui off, gpu off, ipc override, privileged override, runtime/net inherit, env/volume replace, port append -- plus 11 direct `_resolve_docker_flags` unit tests and the full bats suite). Refs #497, #498. Closes #505.
- **`.env` split into `.env.generated` (cache) + `.env` workload overlay (S2 of #497, A2 core; breaking-semantic)** — the derived interpolation cache `setup.sh` writes is renamed `.env` -> `.env.generated`; the `.env` name is repurposed as a hand-authored, gitignored **workload overlay** that `setup.sh` never edits after scaffolding it on first apply. Each generated service now carries `env_file: - .env` so per-task env vars (e.g. `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`, `LOG_LEVEL`, tokens) take effect with `make run` alone -- no compose regenerate, no `SETUP_CONF_HASH` drift, no git churn. The wrappers' compose `--env-file` and every cache read (`write_env`, drift-check, `_load_env`, reset backup) now point at `.env.generated`; `.env.generated` feeds compose interpolation only (it is NOT injected into containers, so USER_UID / PRIVILEGED / SETUP_* metadata do not leak into the runtime env -- the env_file split). `apply` self-heals a pre-#502 layout: a `.env` carrying the auto-gen marker is treated as a stale cache, backed up to `.env.bak`, promoted to `.env.generated`, and a fresh overlay scaffolded -- so every repo migrates automatically on next apply. `.env.generated` added to the canonical gitignore blocklist. Bare `docker compose up` is unsupported (empty interpolation -- the wrappers always pass `--env-file`); this is what frees the `.env` name. The full overlay-overrides-`[environment]`-defaults semantics complete in S3 (when `[environment]` becomes baked `ENV`, the lowest-precedence layer). 17-repo migration is handled by the downstream-upgrade workflow. Refs #497, #498; folds part of #439 (the stale `.env.example` doc references are dropped here).
- **INI read/write consolidated into `lib/conf.sh` via a shared tokenizer (#411)** — the full-file parser `_load_setup_conf_full`, the comment-preserving writer `_write_setup_conf`, and the single-key writer `_upsert_conf_value` moved from the TUI lib `lib/_tui_conf.sh` into `lib/conf.sh` (which already held `_parse_ini_section` since #402), so all `setup.conf` I/O lives in one module instead of the non-interactive core CLI reaching into the TUI lib for parsing/writeback. `_tui_conf.sh` now sources `conf.sh` (idempotent via conf.sh's own guard) so its existing consumers still get the primitives, and is left as pure validators + mount/GPU field assemblers. The two readers (`_parse_ini_section`, `_load_setup_conf_full`) are now thin projections over one new tokenizer `_ini_tokenize`, which emits each entry's `(section, key, value)` triple rather than a lossy `<section>.<key>` string -- this lets `_parse_ini_section` match sections EXACTLY even when keys contain dots (per-stage override keys like `gui.mode` under `[stage:NAME]`) or when a section name contains dots (`[logging.web]` vs `[logging]`), neither of which a namespaced-string split can disambiguate. Pure internal refactor: behaviour is unchanged (full bats suite plus new `_ini_tokenize` and dotted-section / dotted-key characterization tests stay green). Closes #411.
- **`generate_compose_yaml` section emitters deduplicated (#410, partial)** — the `cap_add` / `cap_drop` / `security_opt` / `group_add` / `device_cgroup_rules` / `tmpfs` / `deploy`-GPU blocks were emitted by near-identical inline code in both the devel block and the per-stage standalone block (each iterating the same top-level `[security]` / `[devices]` / `[tmpfs]` strings). They are now shared nested helpers (`_emit_caps_block` / `_emit_group_add_block` / `_emit_cgroup_rules_block` / `_emit_tmpfs_block` / `_emit_gpu_deploy_block`) called from both paths. Pure internal refactor: compose.yaml output is **byte-identical** (verified against golden masters for 5 representative fixtures + the full bats suite). The issue's "single emit loop" goal is intentionally NOT pursued: the code has three principled emission modes (devel emits env-var refs like `${PRIVILEGED}` / `${NETWORK_MODE}` for runtime overridability + is the `extends:` base; per-stage no-override is a minimal `extends: devel`; per-stage override emits resolved literals to suppress inherited values per #220), so a single 3-mode loop would increase branching complexity rather than reduce it. Refs #410.
- **Wrapper bootstrap preamble extracted to `lib/bootstrap.sh` + exit-code standardization (#408 sub-tasks A + C)** — the ~37-line preamble each dispatch wrapper repeated (resolve FILE_PATH across the symlink / script-subfolder / direct / `/lint` layouts, honor `-C/--chdir`, source `_lib.sh`) is hoisted into `_bootstrap "$@"` in the new `lib/bootstrap.sh`. `build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh` / `prune.sh` now open with a short locator (resolves the wrapper's real path via `readlink -f`, tries `../lib/` then `lib/` then `.base/script/docker/lib/` for bootstrap.sh) + `_bootstrap "$@"`, removing ~185 lines of duplication. A broken install (no bootstrap.sh) emits a clear `cannot find lib/bootstrap.sh` diagnostic instead of a cryptic `_bootstrap: command not found`. Also unifies prune.sh's stale flat `${FILE_PATH}/_lib.sh` fallback onto the post-#406 `lib/_lib.sh` path. Exit codes standardized to POSIX convention (sub-task C): argument/usage errors exit 2 (e.g. an invalid `run.sh --instance` value, previously 1), runtime errors exit 1. `setup_tui.sh` keeps its own preamble (it sources the TUI libs, not `_lib.sh`, and takes no `-C`), so it is intentionally out of scope. Refs #408.
- **Wrapper dry-run dispatch unified through `log.sh`'s `_dry_run_cmd` (#408 sub-task B)** — added `_dry_run_cmd <cmd> [args...]` to `lib/log.sh`: under `DRY_RUN=true` it prints the planned command (`[dry-run]` + `%q`-quoted argv) and skips execution, otherwise runs it verbatim. The duplicated inline `if DRY_RUN; then printf '[dry-run] ...'` blocks in `lib/compose.sh` (`_compose`, the central `docker compose` dispatcher behind run/exec/stop/build), `stop.sh` (`_maybe_prune`), `prune.sh` (engine prune + `docker rmi`), and `build.sh` (`init.sh` regen) now delegate to it; output is byte-identical (the wrapper-dispatch specs stay green). `compose.sh` sources `log.sh` directly (idempotent guard, mirrors `config_summary.sh`) so it stays self-sufficient. The test-tools `docker build` path keeps its inline form (its real exec needs a `>/dev/null` redirect `_dry_run_cmd` can't carry). Per-wrapper operational messages already route through `_log_*`; the remaining bare `printf` are the irreducible cases (pre-`_lib.sh` bootstrap errors, interactive `[y/N]` prompts, pre-formatted list output) -- `_log_plain` was removed in #438, so user-facing/interactive output stays raw by design. Refs #408.
- **`[deploy] runtime` renamed to `[deploy] gpu_runtime`** — puts the GPU-runtime key in the GPU family (`gpu_mode` / `gpu_count` / `gpu_capabilities` / `gpu_runtime`) and removes the overloaded "runtime" word in `setup.conf`. `setup.sh` reads `gpu_runtime` first; the old `[deploy] runtime` key keeps working as a **permanent legacy alias** (consumed with a `_log_warn` deprecation; `gpu_runtime` wins when both are present). Per-stage `[stage:X] deploy.gpu_runtime` is accepted (legacy `deploy.runtime` too). The `.env` variable name stays `RUNTIME` for downstream back-compat. Closes #481.
- **`compose.yaml` now carries a top-level `name:`** — `setup.sh` emits `name: ${DOCKER_HUB_USER}-${IMAGE_NAME}${INSTANCE_SUFFIX:-}` (literal, compose-interpolated from `.env`) right after the AUTO-GENERATED header, matching the wrapper's `PROJECT_NAME` rule. Non-wrapper tools (`lazydocker`, plain `docker compose ps`, IDE Docker panels) now resolve the same project name instead of falling back to the directory basename, so they see the wrapper-managed containers. The wrapper's `-p` still wins (compose precedence `-p` > `name:`), so wrapper behaviour is unchanged; `INSTANCE_SUFFIX` expands empty for non-wrapper tools (base instance). Additive: each downstream gains one `name:` line on next regenerate. Closes #472.
- **Wrapper -> compose dispatch is now asserted behaviourally** — new `test/integration/wrapper_compose_dispatch_spec.bats` runs each wrapper (`build` / `run` / `exec` / `stop`) with `--dry-run` and checks the planned `docker compose -p <project> <verb>` (including the `-p` flag), replacing the name-coupled `_compose_project` / `_app_cleanup` greps in `template_spec.bats`. The behavioural assertions are immune to internal renames (which broke the old greps twice during the v0.40.0 cycle: #480's `_compose_dispatch` shim, #484's `_app_cleanup` rename) and additionally catch a raw-`docker compose` bypass (a missing `-p`) that a grep could not. Closes #490.
- **Template privilege defaults are now opt-in (breaking-semantic)** — the template `config/docker/setup.conf` no longer ships `cap_add` (`SYS_ADMIN` / `NET_ADMIN` / `MKNOD`), `security_opt` (`seccomp:unconfined`), or `device_1 = /dev:/dev` defaults, and `privileged` flips from `true` to `false`. They become commented examples. The `privileged` resolution default also flips to `false` so a `[security]` section that omits the key does not silently run privileged. A repo with an empty `[security]` / `[devices]` section (which previously fell back to the fat template baseline) now gets a clean `compose.yaml` with no privilege escalation -- fixing lightweight repos (static servers, CI runners) like `omniverse_web_viewer` that explicitly opted out, and incidentally resolving the over-inheritance of GPU/devices/X11 by tooling stages that `extends: devel` (the #493 Bug B case). Repos that need privileges declare them explicitly via `setup.sh add` / the TUI / uncommenting the template examples; the 15 active repos that already declare their own are unaffected. Closes #466, resolves #493 Bug B.

### Deprecated
- **`[deploy] runtime` legacy alias** — kept working indefinitely (W3 strategy) but scheduled for removal at **v1.0.0**; migrate to `[deploy] gpu_runtime`. Tracked in `doc/deprecations.md` (new -- grep it before cutting v1.0.0). Refs #481.

### Removed
- **`runtime.env` retired (S7 of #497, completes the epic; supersedes #462)** — `setup.sh apply` no longer emits `runtime.env`, and the `_write_runtime_env` helper is deleted. Under the A2 model (#502) its job is covered by two channels that already exist: in-container, `[environment]` defaults are baked as real `ENV` in the runtime image (S3, so a bare `docker run` sees them); host-side standalone helpers (e.g. the isaac `run_instance.sh`) source `.env.generated` (the resolved interpolation cache) + `.env` (the workload overlay) instead. `runtime.env` is dropped from the canonical `.gitignore` blocklist (10 -> 9 entries). The single known downstream consumer (`ycpss91255-docker/isaac`) is migrated via the downstream-upgrade workflow, not this PR -- its `PUBLIC_IP` etc. resolve identically from `.env.generated` + `.env`. `runtime.env` shipped only in v0.40.0 (#462), so no long-lived consumer relies on it. With S1-S7 the #497 epic is complete. Refs #497, #498, #462, #502, #503.

### Fixed
- **detached `run.sh -d` now runs the repo-local `post/run` hook (#537)** — the `post/run` hook (#440) only fired in foreground, via the `trap _app_cleanup EXIT` handler, which detached mode does not install -- so `run.sh -t <stage> -d` silently skipped it (a consumer's documented detached post-bring-up steps, e.g. starting a sidecar / `docker cp`-ing a config into the just-started container, never ran). The detached branch now calls `_run_post_hook run` directly after `compose up -d`, decoupled from the foreground `compose down` teardown (the `-d` lifecycle is user-managed, so no down); hook failure surfaces as a non-zero exit, matching the foreground trap. Closes #537. Refs #440.
- **`test-tools` release downloads retry transient 504s (#550)** — `dockerfile/Dockerfile.test-tools` fetches the `shellcheck` + `hadolint` binaries from the GitHub release CDN at build time; a transient `504` there used to fail the whole `test-tools:local` 3-layer-fallback build first-hit (no retry), which repeatedly blocked code-PR CI during the #497 epic until the CDN recovered. Both `curl` invocations now use `--retry 5 --retry-all-errors --retry-delay 3`, so a 504 / timeout retries transparently instead of failing the build. No image-content change. Closes #550.
- **`upgrade.sh` post-pull integrity check rewritten as R1+ (structural invariant + target match)** — `_verify_subtree_intact` no longer asserts specific files exist at hard-coded paths (the v0.39.0 reorg of `script/docker/setup.sh` -> `wrapper/setup.sh` tripped the legacy marker list and broke `make upgrade v0.39.0+` from any pre-v0.39.0 release; tested v0.34.1 reproducer rolled back at Step 2/5). The new check is path-agnostic: it verifies `${TEMPLATE_REL}/` is a non-empty directory, `${TEMPLATE_REL}/.version` exists and parses as semver, and the pulled version matches the caller's target (catches wrong-tag / wrong-remote pulls that pass the structural check but deliver the wrong thing). Sibling path-coupling regions in upgrade.sh (`init.sh` invocation, `config/` drift detection, Dockerfile lib auto-patch) are intentionally not covered here -- tracked in #492. Pre-v0.39.0 downstream repos still need a manual one-shot patch of their stale `.base/upgrade.sh` before they can reach a version carrying this fix. Closes #477.

### Documentation
- **ADR-00000006: `upgrade.sh` hard-coded paths are a protocol-stable contract (#492)** — declares three `.base/` interior path regions that `upgrade.sh` depends on as protocol-stable (must not move/rename without updating `upgrade.sh` in the same change): `.base/init.sh` (Region A -- direct invocation; a move leaves a half-upgraded repo with no rollback), `.base/config/` + `config/docker/setup.conf` (Region B -- drift detection; a move makes the warning silently no-op), and `.base/script/docker/lib/` + the `script/docker/*.sh` umbrella loaders (Region C -- Dockerfile lint-stage auto-patch; a move breaks the downstream build). Chosen over a path-manifest file or `find`/glob discovery (no new artifact / parse surface / mid-upgrade guessing, for paths with no relocation pressure); the cost is a remembered convention, captured by this ADR + #492's trigger checklist. No code change -- ratifies the existing paths as intentional. Complements the #477 R1+ structural-invariant integrity check (which made the integrity check path-agnostic; this freezes the remaining interior paths). Closes #492.
- **ADR-00000005: adopt `just` over the Makefile wrapper (#475)** — records the decision to replace the GNU make wrapper (`make build` / `run` / ...) with a `just` `justfile`. Root cause: make treats `VAR=VALUE` as overrides and consumes `--`/`-flag` argv for itself, which forced the accreting #414 / #448 / #469 workarounds; `just` passes recipe + trailing args through cleanly so those disappear. Rollout is additive-first (introduce the justfile alongside the Makefile) then retire the Makefile bound to the 13-repo batch fanout (the Makefile is symlinked, so removal must land in lockstep). Records the trade-off vs alternatives (A retire-to-raw-scripts, B custom dispatcher, D keep-patching-make) and resolves the open questions (single-entry is nice-to-have; `make help` -> `just --list`; downstream migration via fanout; CI/IDE callsite grep-sweep; `Makefile.ci` out of scope). Implementation split into #545 (phase 1, additive justfile) + #546 (phase 2, Makefile retirement + fanout). Closes #475.
- **README rewritten against the current codebase (#437)** — the `template` -> `base` rename left the READMEs stale; applied targeted corrections across `README.md` + the three i18n READMEs (zh-TW / zh-CN / ja): title `# template` -> `# base`; both Mermaid diagrams' `template` labels -> `base`; consumer-repo symlink paths corrected to the repo-root `.base/script/docker/wrapper/*.sh` layout (adding `prune.sh` / `setup.sh` / `setup_tui.sh`); CI/CD flow path `./script/build.sh test` -> `./build.sh test`; CI-container label -> `ghcr.io/ycpss91255-docker/test-tools:latest`; the directory tree regenerated from the actual filesystem (adds `script/docker/lib/` modules, `script/docker/runtime/`, `script/ci/` lints, `test/behavioural/`, the full `test/unit/` + `test/integration/` spec set, `config/shell/bashrc.d/`, the ADR set, `doc/deprecations.md`; drops the removed `dockerfile/setup/`); the "What's included" table extended with `prune.sh` / `setup_tui.sh` / the `lib`/`runtime`/`ci` modules; and the Quick Start / TL;DR `git subtree add` switched from `main` to a pinned `vX.Y.Z` tag. Closes #437.
- **env-vs-workload parameter boundary documented (S1 of #497)** — README gains a "Where each parameter lives (env vs workload)" section: the axis-A criterion ("does this value change when you switch machines?"), a 3-channel routing table (machine-bound -> `setup.conf`; volatile env -> `.env` overlay; structured config -> app YAML), and which channels survive a field deployment that ships only the image. The template `setup.conf` `[environment]` comment is reworded to mark the section as machine-bound / set-once env defaults (the future runtime-stage `ENV` bake, #497 S3) and to point per-task / volatile env vars at the gitignored `.env` overlay (#497 S2) instead. Conceptual / foundational only -- no behaviour change; the `.env` overlay, `ENV` bake, and `deploy.sh` launcher mechanics land across the rest of the #497 epic. Refs #497, ADR-00000003. Closes #501.

## [v0.40.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- **`EXEC_ARGS` env var passthrough for `make exec`** — Kit-style args containing `=` (e.g. `--/app/livestream/port=49100`) historically tripped the #414 `MAKEOVERRIDES` guard, forcing users to call `./script/exec.sh` directly. Setting `EXEC_ARGS='--/app/k=v ...'` in the env now forwards those tokens to `exec.sh` via `$(EXEC_ARGS)`, bypassing make's variable-override interception. Existing `make exec -- -t target cmd` invocations are unaffected; EXEC_ARGS is appended after the `--`-forwarded args. Documented in README + zh-TW/zh-CN/ja translations. Closes #469.
- **Per-instance compose overlay for `run.sh --instance NAME`** — `run.sh --instance NAME` now also auto-detects `config/instances/<NAME>.yaml` (compose `-f` overlay) and `config/instances/<NAME>.env` (compose `--env-file` overlay) on top of the existing `INSTANCE_SUFFIX`-only behaviour. Either file may exist alone; missing files are silently skipped. Yaml handles structural overrides (per-instance ports, volumes, cache dirs); env handles pure `${VAR}` overrides shared with `compose.yaml`. `NAME` is validated against `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$` (lowercase alphanumeric + `_-`) for path safety -- `--instance ../etc/passwd` and similar are rejected up front. New `lib/compose.sh::_compose_project_with_overlay` wraps the underlying invocation; `lib/compose.sh::_validate_instance_name` enforces the rule. README + 3 translations updated. Closes #465.
- **Per-wrapper `pre`/`post` hooks for downstream host-side customisation** — every wrapper (`run` / `build` / `exec` / `stop` / `prune` / `setup` / `setup_tui`) now sources `lib/hook.sh` via `lib/_lib.sh` and calls `_run_pre_hook <name>` after env validation and `_run_post_hook <name>` at the end of main (run.sh's renamed `_app_cleanup` EXIT trap covers Ctrl-C too). Hooks live at `script/hooks/{pre,post}/<wrapper>.sh`; `init.sh` creates 14 executable stubs on new-repo (idempotent on existing-repo / upgrade so pre-#440 templates pick up scaffolding). Pre-hook non-zero exit aborts the wrapper; post-hook non-zero overrides the wrapper exit code but `compose down` still runs (strict + cleanup). `--dry-run` skips both hooks per the no-side-effects contract. Non-executable hook files hard-fail with a clear `chmod +x` hint. Solves `jetson_sdk_manager`'s need to register `qemu-aarch64` binfmt on the host before run.sh launches the ARM64 container, without breaking the upstream-symlink upgrade chain. Closes #440.
- **`build-worker.yaml` `free_disk_space` opt-in input** — pre-build cleanup step that runs `jlumbroso/free-disk-space@main` to remove ~30 GB of pre-installed runner tooling (Android SDK, .NET, GHC, tool-cache) so repos whose `BASE_IMAGE` exceeds ubuntu-latest's ~14 GB free disk (Isaac Sim ~15 GB extracted) stop deterministically hitting `no space left on device` during the BuildKit COPY phase. Default `false` preserves zero behavior change for existing small-image callers; downstream opts in with `with: free_disk_space: true`. Step is positioned before `Set up Docker Buildx` so the overlayfs snapshot dir lands on the freed space. Closes #470.
- **`runtime.env` emitted by `setup.sh apply`** — `[environment] env_*` entries land in a new `runtime.env` file alongside `.env` / `compose.yaml`, with the same cross-ref expansion as compose. Standalone scripts that bypass compose (e.g. `docker run` wrappers, host-side helpers like `isaac/script/run_instance.sh`) can now `source runtime.env` and see the same values compose injects, instead of getting empty `PUBLIC_IP` (WebRTC ICE fell back to 127.0.0.1). Backwards compatible: `.env` and `compose.yaml` unchanged; opt-in for callers that need it. Added to `_canonical_gitignore_entries` so downstream repos pick it up via the next `make upgrade`. Closes #462.
- **TUI mount mode picker for `[devices]`/`[volumes]`** — new `_prompt_mount_with_picker` walks the user through host path, container path, access mode (`ro`/`rw`/none), and propagation mode (`rslave`/`rshared`/`rprivate`/`slave`/`shared`/`private`/none) via separate radiolist prompts. Pure `_assemble_mount_value` helper builds the final `host:container[:mode]` string. Lets users discover propagation modes from #450 without reading docs. Closes #461.
- **`runtime/smoke.sh` ldd-based missing-dep check** — new helper script scans `.so` files under given roots (default `/usr/local/lib` + `/opt/ros/*/lib`) and fails if any has a "not found" dependency. Default `RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD` in `Dockerfile.example` now invokes it, catching missing shared-library installs that the old `whoami && bash --version` default silently passed (e.g. `libboost_regex.so` absent in ros1_bridge#123). Downstream repos that uncomment the runtime-test stage get the stronger check automatically. Closes #430.

### Changed
- **`[logging] local_path` gitignore sync moved to init/upgrade lifecycle** — previously fired on every `setup.sh apply` (so the `.gitignore` managed block was only refreshed when a wrapper ran). New `lib/gitignore.sh::_sync_logging_gitignore` is called from `init.sh` (both new-repo and existing-repo paths), and `upgrade.sh` re-runs `init.sh`, so the file stays in step across template versions even when no wrapper has fired since the last `setup.conf` edit. Behaviour-equivalent: same marker block, same prune logic. `_parse_ini_section` also relocates from `setup.sh` to `lib/conf.sh` so `init.sh` can reach the parser without sourcing `setup.sh`. Closes #402.
- **`[logging]` parsers extracted to `lib/conf_logging.sh`** — `_parse_logging_svc_sections` and `_collect_logging` moved out of `script/docker/wrapper/setup.sh` into a new shared lib, wired via `lib/_lib.sh`. Internal refactor only; no behaviour change. Sets up PR-B (#402) where `lib/gitignore.sh` will reuse the same parsers to take over the `[logging] local_path` gitignore sync from `setup.sh apply`. Refs #402.

### Fixed
- **`run.sh` non-devel stages now use `compose up`** — previously used `compose run --rm` which generated random hash container names (e.g. `user-repo-runtime-run-63e8313ab536`), bypassing the `container_name:` directive emitted by `setup.sh` (#215, #322, #335). Empty CMD → foreground `compose up`; CMD passed → `compose up -d` + `compose exec`. Container names now consistent across all stages. Closes #458.

## [v0.39.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- **`[devices]` mount propagation support** — device entries like `device_1 = /dev:/dev:rslave` are auto-redirected from compose `devices:` to `volumes:` long-form bind mount (compose `devices:` does not support propagation). Plain devices without propagation emit to `devices:` as before. Validator (`_validate_mount`) extended to accept `rslave|rshared|rprivate|slave|shared|private` modes, combinable with `ro|rw` (e.g. `rw,rslave`). Warns when propagation is used without `[security] privileged = true` (P2, #453). Warns on duplicate target paths between `[devices]` and `[volumes]` (P4, #455). Per-stage emit supports propagation (P3, #454). Closes #450, closes #453, closes #454, closes #455.

### Changed
- **`run.sh` CMD separator `--` + positional stop** — first positional arg now stops run.sh flag parsing so CMD flags like `--target` no longer collide with run.sh's own `-t/--target`. Explicit `--` separator documented in usage (4 languages). Closes #448.
- **`script/docker/` reorganized into role-based subdirectories** — wrappers move to `wrapper/`, all libs consolidate into `lib/`, container-side helpers move to `runtime/`. `_entrypoint_logging.sh` renamed to `runtime/logging.sh` (container path `/usr/local/lib/base/logging.sh`). New `runtime/entrypoint.sh` template replaces init.sh heredoc. Breaking: downstream symlink paths change; `make upgrade` handles migration automatically. Closes #406.

## [v0.38.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **`build-worker.yaml` `submodules` input** — optional checkout mode (`true` / `recursive`) for repos whose Dockerfile source lives in a git submodule. Default empty string preserves existing behavior (no submodule checkout). Only the `build` job checkout is affected; `path-filter` stays `submodules: false`. Closes #444.

## [v0.37.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **`make start` combined build+run target** — runs `./script/build.sh` then `./script/run.sh` in one step, reducing friction for new repo onboarding. Args after `--` are forwarded to build.sh only; run.sh runs with defaults. Closes #428.

### Changed
- **`run.sh` first-run auto-build gate** — when the target image is missing locally, `run.sh` now delegates to `./build.sh <target>` instead of letting Compose auto-build (which silently skips the test stage). Makes `make run` on a fresh clone equivalent to `make build && make run`. Build failure aborts the run. The `--build` flag (explicit `./build.sh test` with lint+smoke) is unchanged. Closes #429.
- **`lib/log.sh` single-sink tty-detect + strict body + microsecond UTC** (#438). (1) Dispatch switches on `test -t <fd>`: TTY emits text, pipe/redirect emits JSON; `LOG_FORMAT=auto|text|json` overrides. `LOG_JSON_FILE` dual-sink removed. (2) Unregistered body is a fatal error by default; all callers migrated to registered event names with `display=` attribute for i18n text. (3) Timestamps now ISO 8601 UTC with microsecond precision (`%6NZ`) in both text and JSON. (4) `_log_plain` removed; `config_summary.sh` uses local `_summary_print` helper. Breaking changes: `LOG_JSON_FILE` env dropped, `LOG_STRICT_BODY` env dropped (strict is now default). Closes #438.

## [v0.36.0] - 2026-05-27

### Changed
- **`lib/log.sh` rewritten as OTel-aligned 5-level JSON logger** (P1 of #423). 5 functions (`_log_debug` / `_log_info` / `_log_warn` / `_log_err` / `_log_fatal`) with `(service, body, [attr=val]...)` API. Registered body emits JSON per OTel Logs Data Model; unregistered body falls back to legacy text for backward compat. W3C TRACEPARENT propagation via `_log_with_trace` / `_log_with_span` scoped wrappers. Ships `lib/log-events.txt` (body enum registry) and `lib/log.lnav-format.json`. Closes #423.
- **`lib/log.sh` dual output + text format upgrade** (P2). Terminal always receives text with ISO 8601 timestamp + 5-char aligned level (`DEBUG`/`INFO`/`WARN`/`ERROR`/`FATAL`). `LOG_JSON_FILE` env enables parallel structured JSON output to file. `attr=val` args are filtered from text display but included in JSON. `WARNING` label shortened to `WARN` for alignment. i18n messages preserved in text mode only.
- **P3+P4: bare stderr migration + lint enforcement**. Converted remaining bare `printf >&2` in `setup.sh`, `run.sh`, `ci.sh` to `_log_*` helpers. Added `script/ci/lint_bare_stderr.sh` to flag bare stderr output outside `_log_*` / `_die` / allowlisted patterns.

## [v0.35.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added
- **`[network] pid` setting** for PID namespace mode (`host` / `private`). Default `private` (Docker default). Set `pid = host` when running multiple GPU-rendering containers on the same GPU to avoid NVIDIA driver pthread robust mutex failures (`ESRCH`). Follows the `[network] ipc` precedent: setup.conf -> `.env` `PID_MODE` -> compose.yaml `pid:`. Per-stage override and TUI selection (4 languages) included. Closes #412.
- **`build-worker.yaml` `extra_stages` input** — opt-in comma-separated list of extra Dockerfile stages to build after the standard pipeline. For each stage `<name>`, if a corresponding `<name>-test` stage exists in the Dockerfile it is built first (same convention as `devel-test` / `runtime-test`). Each extra stage gets its own GHA cache scope. Blocklist validation rejects attempts to re-build standard pipeline stages. Closes #415.

### Changed
- **`.hadolint.yaml` cleanup** — removed 5 globally ignored rules (DL3003, DL3006, DL3007, DL3046, DL4006) and properly fixed the underlying violations: pinned bats/alpine versions via `ARG` in `Dockerfile.test-tools`, added `-l` flag to `useradd` in `Dockerfile.example`, replaced `RUN cd` with `WORKDIR`, and moved DL4006 to inline ignore on the Alpine `RUN` with pipe. Closes #405.

### Removed
- **`dockerfile/setup/` pip scaffolding** — removed entirely (reverses #261). `python3-pip` dropped from `Dockerfile.example` apt install, `SETUP_DIR` ARG and all COPY/RUN pip references removed. Downstream repos that need pip handle it independently in their own Dockerfiles. Closes #407.

### Fixed
- **Makefile forwarding: absolute container paths** — `make exec -- /root/demo/test.sh` failed with `No rule to make target` because GNU Make's built-in implicit rules stat every goal on the host filesystem. Added `--no-builtin-rules` + `.SUFFIXES:` so the `%:` catch-all fires correctly for arbitrary absolute paths. Closes #414 (case 2).
- **Makefile forwarding: VAR=VALUE args silently lost** — `make setup set build.arg_4 ROS2_DISTRO=jazzy` dropped the `ROS2_DISTRO=jazzy` token because Make treats any `KEY=VALUE` CLI token as a variable override, not a goal. Added a `MAKEOVERRIDES` guard that detects swallowed args and aborts with a clear error message pointing users to the underlying script. Closes #414 (case 1).
- `upgrade.sh` #399 idempotency regex false-positive: `COPY script/*.sh /lint/script/` was matching the already-patched check because `/lint/` is a prefix of `/lint/script/`. Anchored the regex with `$` so only the exact `/lint/` destination triggers the skip. Closes #403.

## [v0.34.1] - 2026-05-25

Patch release: single feature from #399 / PR #400.

### Added

- **`upgrade.sh` auto-patches downstream Dockerfile `COPY *.sh /lint/`
  → `COPY script/*.sh /lint/`** (closes #399). v0.31.0 (#330) moved
  user-facing wrappers from the repo root into a `script/` subfolder;
  `init.sh` migrates the symlinks but the Dockerfile's COPY directive
  is user-owned and stayed anchored at root, pulling zero files after
  the migration. Every post-#330 fanout hit the same smoke-test
  failure (`build.sh -h exits 0` → `assert_success` failed because
  `/lint/build.sh` did not exist). `upgrade.sh` now detects the stale
  `COPY *.sh /lint/` pattern and rewrites it to `COPY script/*.sh
  /lint/` in the same chore commit, so the next fanout is clean.
  Idempotent: already-patched Dockerfiles are skipped. Modelled on
  the #348 `COPY .base/script/docker/lib` sibling patch.

## [v0.34.0] - 2026-05-21

Stable v0.34.0 minor feature release, promoting v0.34.0-rc1 (#396) with no follow-up fixes — RC tag CI (`Self Test` + `release-test-tools`) was green.

Single feature carried over from #390 / PR #395 (full detail under [v0.34.0-rc1] below):

- **#390 / PR #395** — `setup.sh apply` prunes stale `[logging] local_path` entries from the managed `.gitignore` block, plus docs example flipped `./logs/` → `./log/` (singular-directory convention).

Downstream consumers receive the change on next `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=v0.34.0`. The 12 of 13 downstream repos that inherit base's empty default `local_path` see no change. `ros1_bridge` (the one that overrides to `./logs/`) needs a small follow-up PR to flip its override to `./log/`; the new prune logic will then clean the stale `/logs/` line from its `.gitignore` on next `setup.sh apply`. Fan out across the 2 active downstream repos via `/batch-template-upgrade v0.34.0` after this tag's CI is green.

## [v0.34.0-rc1] - 2026-05-21

Release Candidate for v0.34.0 — single feature PR carried over from #390 that landed too late for the v0.33.0 window. Also doubles as the CHANGELOG-history fix that relocates the #390 entry out of `[v0.33.0-rc1]` (where the rebase replay misplaced it; the actual v0.33.0 GitHub release notes never included #390 since the entry was added in [Unreleased] AFTER v0.33.0 was tagged).

### Added

- **`setup.sh apply` prunes stale `[logging] local_path` entries
  from the managed `.gitignore` block** (#390). Pre-#390 the helper
  `_sync_logging_local_paths_gitignore` only appended; when a
  downstream rewrote its `local_path` value (e.g. `./logs/` →
  `./log/` to match the project's singular directory convention),
  the prior `/logs/` entry persisted forever inside the managed
  marker block. Post-#390 each apply rewrites the block to exactly
  the current candidate set: stale entries drop out, new ones
  appear, and when the resulting block is empty the marker comment
  itself is removed so a feature-off repo carries no trace. Lines
  outside the managed block stay user-owned and untouched.

  Also relocates the docs example from `./logs/` → `./log/` to align
  with the project's singular-directory convention (`script/` /
  `test/` / `doc/` / `config/` / `dockerfile/`). The default
  `local_path` stays empty (opt-in semantics preserved) so consumers
  inheriting the default see no change; only repos that override to
  the new singular form will materialise a `log/` directory.

## [v0.33.0] - 2026-05-21

Stable v0.33.0 minor feature release, promoting v0.33.0-rc1 (#393) with no follow-up fixes — RC tag CI (`Self Test` + `release-test-tools`) was green and the three feature PRs already shipped with full integration coverage (1356 → 1440 tests, +84 across the three lifecycle changes).

Two BREAKING default-flips + one Added opt-in mode (full detail under [v0.33.0-rc1] below):

- **#386 / PR #389** — `run.sh` foreground exit now auto compose-down (`--no-rm` opts out).
- **#387 / PR #391** — `build.sh` after success auto rmi displaced predecessor (`--no-prune` opts out).
- **#388 / PR #392** — new `prune.sh --worktree-orphans` opt-in mode, owner-strict safety gates.

Downstream consumers receive the changes on next `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=v0.33.0`. The two BREAKING items are behavior changes only — no API or invocation shape changes — so the upgrade is a documentation-only event for callers that don't rely on the pre-#386 keep-alive or pre-#387 keep-old-image defaults. Fan out across the 2 active downstream repos via `/batch-template-upgrade v0.33.0` after this tag's CI is green.

## [v0.33.0-rc1] - 2026-05-21

Release Candidate for v0.33.0 — bundled lifecycle-cleanup wave:

- **#386 / PR #389** `run.sh` auto compose-down on foreground exit (BREAKING; `--no-rm` opts out).
- **#387 / PR #391** `build.sh` auto-prune displaced predecessor image (BREAKING; `--no-prune` opts out).
- **#388 / PR #392** `prune.sh --worktree-orphans` opt-in mode (Added; owner-strict safety gates).

Closes the multi-worktree-workflow lifecycle leaks (orphan `<projname>_default` networks; dangling `<none>:<none>` images from rebuilt tags; tagged orphans from removed worktrees). The two BREAKING entries are default-flip with explicit escape hatches — downstream pulls should not need code changes, only awareness when `./run.sh` / `./build.sh` behave differently on exit / completion. See per-entry detail below.

### Added

- **`./prune.sh --worktree-orphans`** (#388). New opt-in mode that
  removes tagged images left behind by removed worktrees. Algorithm:
  for each tagged image matching `<owner>/<name>-<suffix>:<tag>` where
  `<owner>` equals the current `DOCKER_HUB_USER` (loaded from `.env`
  or detected via the same chain `setup.sh` uses), check if
  `<workspace>/worktree/<name>-<suffix>/` exists — if not, the
  worktree is gone and the tagged image is an orphan. `docker image
  prune` cannot reach these (not dangling), and `docker system prune
  -a` is too aggressive (kills every idle tagged image on the
  daemon). Closes the leak case for the multi-worktree workflow where
  `git worktree remove` wipes the cwd before the image is cleaned.

  Safety gates: bare-name images (no `<owner>/` prefix) and images
  owned by a different `<other>/` prefix are **always skipped** —
  ownership cannot be confirmed, so we refuse to delete. Cleaning
  those is left to manual `docker rmi`.

  Companion flags:
  - `--workspace <dir>` to point at the workspace root (defaults to
    `WS_PATH` from `.env` when run from a repo with one).
  - `--owner <name>` to override the detected owner (rare; useful
    when migrating images between machines).
  - `--repo <name>` (repeatable) to scope the scan to a specific repo
    basename — only `<owner>/<name>-*` candidates considered.
  - `-y` / `--dry-run` honored same as the existing prune flags.

  Not included in `--all` (requires workspace + filesystem context
  that the bulk prune doesn't have). Chain explicitly:
  `./prune.sh --all --worktree-orphans`.

### BREAKING

- **`./build.sh` now auto-prunes the displaced predecessor image after
  a successful build** (#387). Pre-#387: every rebuild that moved the
  same tag (e.g. `mockuser/mockimg:devel`) left the old image ID
  dangling as `<none>:<none>` on the daemon; one dev box accumulated
  281 images / 357 GB / 200+ dangling before anyone noticed. Post-#387:
  build.sh snapshots the tag's image ID before invoking
  `_compose_project build`, and on success runs `docker rmi <old-id>`
  iff (a) the ID actually moved AND (b) no other tag still references
  the old ID. Surgical scope — only the image we just displaced; never
  touches the buildx cache (use `prune.sh --builder` for that), other
  repos' tagged images, or volumes. Pass **`--no-prune`** to opt out
  (keep the previous version around for rollback / debug-diff).
  First-build, cache-hit no-op, multi-tag, and build-failure paths are
  all guarded — no rmi attempted in those cases. Under `--dry-run` a
  `[dry-run] docker rmi <old-id-of <tag> if displaced>` line surfaces
  for visibility without touching the daemon.

- **`./run.sh` foreground exit now auto-tears-down the compose
  project by default** (#386). Pre-#386: leaving an interactive
  `./run.sh` session (or any one-shot `-t test` / `-t runtime`
  invocation) left the container and the compose project's default
  network on the daemon; users had to run `./stop.sh` separately, and
  worktree workflows accumulated orphan `<projname>_default` networks
  when `git worktree remove` deleted the cwd before `./stop.sh` could
  resolve. Post-#386: a `trap _compose_cleanup EXIT` is installed for
  every foreground invocation (devel + non-devel) and runs
  `COMPOSE_PROFILES='*' docker compose ... down --remove-orphans -t 0`
  — same teardown stop.sh performs — on normal exit, Ctrl-C, and
  signal. Pass **`--no-rm`** to restore the pre-#386 keep-alive
  behavior (re-attach later via `./exec.sh`, inspect post-mortem
  logs). `-d` / `--detach` is unchanged (background lifecycle is
  already user-managed; the trap is suppressed automatically).

### Changed

- **`build-worker.yaml` buildx GHA cache split into 4 per-target
  scopes** (#378 b1 mitigation). Pre-#378 all 4 build steps
  (`devel-test` / `devel` / `runtime-test` / `runtime`) shared one
  `<image_name>[-<variant>]-<hardware>-cache` scope under `mode=max`,
  so a late-stage `COPY .base/...` change in `devel` cascaded the
  shared scope's manifest pointer and invalidated `runtime` /
  `runtime-test` caches on the next PR. Each target now writes to its
  own scope: `<base>-devel-test-cache`, `<base>-devel-cache`,
  `<base>-runtime-test-cache`, `<base>-runtime-cache`. **Migration
  cost**: every existing GHA cache entry is orphaned by the shape
  change; first PR per active downstream pays a 4-way cold restart
  (sequentially within the same build job — the 4 build steps share
  layers via the buildx local store, so the wall-time hit is
  meaningfully less than 4×). After that, every PR enjoys
  per-target-isolated caches. Caller contract (workflow `inputs:`)
  unchanged. Refs the b1 mitigation direction in the #378 audit
  comment.

### Fixed

- **`exec.sh` one-shot commands no longer leak terminal escape
  sequences** (#382). Pre-fix, `docker compose exec` defaulted to
  `-it` so a one-shot like `./exec.sh bash -c 'ls /foo'` inherited
  the host terminal's focus-in / bracketed-paste sequences (e.g.
  `^[[I^[[I`) into stdout, polluting downstream pipelines.

### Added

- **`exec.sh` gained `-T` / `--no-tty`, `-i` / `--tty`, plus auto-
  detect for `bash|sh|dash|zsh|ash|ksh -c '...'`** (#382, Option 1+2).
  Three-tier resolution with last-wins between the explicit flags:
  - Explicit `-T` / `--no-tty` → no TTY (`docker compose exec -T`).
    Use for one-shots the auto-detect heuristic misses (`whoami`,
    `ls /foo`, `env BAR=1 bash -c '...'`).
  - Explicit `-i` / `--tty` → TTY. Use to override the auto-detect
    when a `bash -c '...'` invocation genuinely wants a TTY (e.g.
    `-i bash -c 'tput cols'`).
  - Auto-detect: first positional `bash|sh|dash|zsh|ash|ksh` plus
    a following `-c` → no TTY (covers the 90% one-shot wrapping
    pattern).
  - Otherwise: keep `-it` (preserves `./exec.sh` and
    `./exec.sh htop` muscle memory).

  Usage text + examples updated in all 4 languages (en / zh-TW /
  zh-CN / ja).
- **Bats matrix shards + dedicated coverage job in `self-test.yaml`**
  (#377). Three new sibling jobs replace the pre-#377 monolithic
  `test` job:
  - `bats-unit` (matrix `shard: ['1/2', '2/2']`, `fail-fast: false`) —
    each shard runs a round-robin partition of `test/unit/*_spec.bats`
    via `ci.sh --bats-unit-shard ${{ matrix.shard }}`. Drops PR
    wall-time from ~5min serial to ~2min parallel.
  - `bats-integration` — runs `test/integration/` via
    `ci.sh --bats-integration`. Pulled out of the unit serial path.
  - `coverage` — gated on `push && ref == refs/heads/main`. Runs the
    full Kcov pipeline (`ci.sh --coverage`) and uploads to Codecov.
    Intentionally NOT in `ci-rollup`'s `needs:` so a coverage hiccup
    never blocks PR merge. The Codecov upload step migrated here from
    the old `test` job.

  `ci-rollup needs:` reshaped to
  `[actionlint, classify, shellcheck, hadolint, bats-unit,
  bats-integration, integration-e2e, behavioural]`. `release needs:`
  swaps `test` → `bats-unit + bats-integration`. The old `test` job
  is fully removed.
- **Dedicated `shellcheck` + `hadolint` parallel jobs in
  `self-test.yaml`** (#376). ShellCheck runs on plain ubuntu-latest
  (pre-installed binary, no buildx, no test-tools image) via
  `script/ci/ci.sh --shellcheck-only` — a 30s regression now surfaces
  in ~45s wall time instead of waiting for the full bats suite inside
  the `test` job. Hadolint uses
  `hadolint/hadolint-action@v3.1.0` to lint
  `dockerfile/Dockerfile.example` + `dockerfile/Dockerfile.test-tools`
  (template-owned; downstream consumers inherit). Both jobs gate on
  `needs.classify.outputs.code_changed == 'true'` so doc-only PRs SKIP
  them. `ci-rollup`'s `needs:` and the `release` job's `needs:` both
  extend to include these two jobs.
- **`ci-rollup` aggregator job in `self-test.yaml`** (#337). A single
  always-running job sits downstream of every PR check and collapses
  results into one pass/fail signal. Hard-mandatory jobs (actionlint /
  classify / test) must succeed; conditionally-gated jobs (shellcheck
  / hadolint / integration-e2e / behavioural) may be SKIPPED (their
  job-level `if:` gates fire on doc-only / non-behavioural PRs per
  #317 P1/P3, #376). Enables follow-up sub-jobs (#377 bats-unit /
  bats-integration / coverage) to join the rollup's `needs:` list
  without further branch-protection churn. **Branch protection
  switched from `test` → `ci-rollup` post-merge** (admin step,
  separate from the workflow change).

### Changed

- **`script/ci/ci.sh` gained `--shellcheck-only`, `--bats-only`,
  `--bats-unit-shard N/T`, and `--bats-integration` flags** (#376,
  #377). `--shellcheck-only` short-circuits before any mode dispatch
  and runs the lint phase directly on the host (no compose, no
  apt-install) — caller must have `shellcheck` in PATH.
  `--bats-only`, `--bats-unit-shard N/T`, and `--bats-integration`
  plumb `BATS_ONLY=1` plus the appropriate `BATS_UNIT_SHARD` /
  `BATS_INTEGRATION` env var through `_run_via_compose` to the inner
  `--ci` dispatch, which then routes to the right subset of the bats
  suite (and skips `_run_shellcheck` in all three). Local `make test`
  keeps the full pipeline (shellcheck + bats unit + bats integration)
  unchanged because none of these flags is set by default.
- **`script/ci/ci.sh` factored `_run_tests` into `_run_unit_tests` +
  `_run_integration_tests` + new `_run_unit_shard <N>/<T>`** (#377).
  Shared parallelism / label-formatting logic extracted into
  `_bats_args_with_label`. Round-robin partition over
  `find test/unit -name '*_spec.bats' | sort` keeps each shard's file
  count balanced at the current ~30 spec scale; weight-by-test-count
  is a deferred follow-up.

## [v0.32.0] - 2026-05-15

Stable v0.32.0 minor feature release, promoting v0.32.0-rc1 (#371)
plus three logging-feature follow-up fixes:

- **#368 / PR #372** — ship `_entrypoint_logging.sh` into every
  downstream image at `/usr/local/lib/base/_entrypoint_logging.sh`
  so the source-line works at build-time AND runtime in every
  workspace layout.
- **#364 / PR #373** — `init.sh` default-sources the helper from
  the generated `script/entrypoint.sh`, closing the v0.30.0 2-knob
  UX gap (set `local_path` is now the only step for new repos).
- **#367 / PR #374** — `setup.sh` emits per-stage `LOG_FILE_PATH` +
  volume mount on extends-based compose services so per-service
  file naming (`runtime.log`, `builder.log`) materialises instead
  of inheriting devel's `LOG_FILE_PATH=devel.log` through compose
  `extends` merge.

Bundled BREAKING from v0.32.0-rc1 (carried below): `#344` rewrite
of `multi-distro-build-worker.yaml` from 1D scalar-axis to N-D
`include`-shape matrix-mode. Callers using the dispatcher must
migrate from `pr_distros` / `tag_distros` / `distro_input_name` /
`extra_build_args` to `pr_matrix` / `tag_matrix` (full JSON
`include`-shape arrays of `{name, build_args, ...}` entries). The
3 caller migration tracking issues remain open (ros1_bridge#108,
ros_distro#24, ros2_distro#23); ros1_bridge migration follows in
this session as Phase 3 of the original #344 plan.

External callers reusing `multi-distro-build-worker.yaml@vX.Y.Z`
break — the `### Changed` entry under [v0.32.0-rc1] carries the
full input migration table.

### Fixed

- `script/docker/setup.sh`: emit per-stage `LOG_FILE_PATH` env var
  and `[logging] local_path` volume mount on extends-based compose
  services (the zero-diff `extends: service: devel` branch from
  #215, used by auto-emitted Dockerfile stages like `builder` /
  `runtime` / `test-tools-stage`). Closes #367. The v0.30.0 emit
  was three-point (devel inline / standalone auto-emitted stages
  with overrides / test); the zero-diff extends path was missing,
  so compose's `extends` merge inherited devel's
  `LOG_FILE_PATH=/var/log/<repo>/devel.log` into every extending
  service. `./run.sh -d runtime` ended up tee'ing the runtime
  container's stdout to `logs/devel.log` instead of
  `logs/runtime.log`. Result: per-service file naming
  (`runtime.log`, `builder.log`, ...) silently never materialised;
  users running multiple services concurrently got interleaved
  content in `logs/devel.log`. Fix is Option A from #367: every
  service block now emits its own `LOG_FILE_PATH` +
  `<resolved>:/var/log/<repo>` volume mount uniformly when
  `local_path` is set, regardless of whether the service uses
  `extends`. compose's `environment:` list merge concatenates entries
  and last-wins resolution at runtime picks the override; the
  duplicate volume mount string against the inherited one is
  harmless because compose dedups identical bind strings.
  Back-compat: when `local_path` is unset the zero-diff emit stays
  byte-for-byte identical to pre-#367, so repos that haven't opted
  into `[logging] local_path` see zero change. 3 new tests in
  `compose_logging_spec.bats` (extending stage LOG_FILE_PATH emit,
  volume mount emit, and back-compat no-emit when local_path
  unset).

- `init.sh` now default-sources `_entrypoint_logging.sh` from the
  stable in-image path `/usr/local/lib/base/_entrypoint_logging.sh`
  in the generated `script/entrypoint.sh`, closing the v0.30.0
  `[logging] local_path` UX gap (#364). Before this change, the
  user-facing model was 2-knob: edit `setup.conf` AND hand-add a
  source line to `entrypoint.sh`; out-of-the-box, setting `local_path`
  emitted `LOG_FILE_PATH` env + the host volume mount in
  `compose.yaml` but no file ever materialised because the helper
  was never sourced. Default-sourcing is no-op safe
  (`_entrypoint_logging.sh:51` early-returns when `LOG_FILE_PATH`
  is unset), so stock repos see zero behavioural change. **New
  repos** generated via `init.sh` from this version on get the
  helper pre-wired — setting `[logging] local_path` is now the
  only step. **Existing repos** need a one-time manual addition of
  the source line before `exec` in `script/entrypoint.sh`;
  `init.sh` / `upgrade.sh` deliberately do NOT modify existing
  entrypoints to preserve downstream customisations (ROS sourcing,
  conda activation, etc). The emitted source line uses the in-image
  path shipped by #368 / PR #372 (no `$USER` deref, no workspace
  bind-mount dependence), so it works at build-time AND runtime
  across every workspace layout. README (en + 3 translations)
  gains a "Logging output to host" section covering the 1-step
  setup, the existing-repo migration line, and a `grep`
  troubleshooting hint. `test/integration/init_new_repo_spec.bats`
  gains one assertion verifying the freshly-generated entrypoint
  contains the source line + explanatory comment, plus regression
  guards against the broken v0.30.0 example (`${USER}` / `/home/`
  must be absent). Closes #364.

- `dockerfile/Dockerfile.example`, `script/docker/_entrypoint_logging.sh`,
  `config/docker/setup.conf`: ship `_entrypoint_logging.sh` into every
  downstream image at the stable in-image path
  `/usr/local/lib/base/_entrypoint_logging.sh` so the documented
  source-line works at build-time AND runtime in every workspace
  layout (#368). The v0.30.0 example
  `. /home/${USER}/work/.base/script/docker/_entrypoint_logging.sh`
  had two failure modes that hit every adopter: (a) `$USER` is unset
  in the Dockerfile test stage, so `set -u` entrypoints crashed
  during build-time bats smoke (`USER: unbound variable`); (b) on
  multi-repo workspace layouts (the org-wide norm), `WS_PATH` resolves
  to the workspace parent rather than the repo root, so the bind mount
  `<WS_PATH>:/home/<user>/work` places the repo's `.base/` at
  `/home/<user>/work/<repo>/.base/`, not the documented
  `/home/<user>/work/.base/` -- the helper silently never ran and
  no host-side log file was ever produced. Path A fix: Dockerfile.example's
  devel stage now COPYs `.base/script/docker/_entrypoint_logging.sh`
  into `/usr/local/lib/base/_entrypoint_logging.sh`, the commented-out
  runtime stage block carries a matching COPY example, and the helper
  header + setup.conf `[logging]` comment block both document the
  in-image source-line. Downstream entrypoints can adopt the helper
  with a single un-guarded line:
  ```
  . /usr/local/lib/base/_entrypoint_logging.sh
  ```
  The line is safe to add unconditionally because the helper is a
  no-op when `LOG_FILE_PATH` is unset; repos that haven't opted into
  `[logging] local_path` stay unaffected. Existing downstream guards
  (e.g. ros1_bridge#107's `if [[ -f ... ]]` + `${USER:-root}`) become
  unnecessary and can be simplified in a follow-up PR. 5 new tests:
  3 in `template_spec.bats` (Dockerfile.example devel COPY directive +
  stage placement, commented runtime stage COPY example, helper header
  positive + negative regression guards), 1 in `compose_logging_spec.bats`
  (setup.conf `[logging]` comment block path reference + negative guard),
  1 in `init_new_repo_spec.bats` (init.sh-generated Dockerfile contains
  the helper COPY).

## [v0.32.0-rc1] - 2026-05-15

Release Candidate for v0.32.0 minor feature release. Bundles a
single BREAKING change: **#344 multi-distro-build-worker N-D
matrix-mode** (merged via #370). The dispatcher's 1D inputs
(`pr_distros` / `tag_distros` / `distro_input_name` /
`extra_build_args`) are removed; callers must use `pr_matrix` /
`tag_matrix` (full JSON `include`-shape arrays of
`{name, build_args, ...}` entries). Migration unlocks first-time
adoption of the dispatcher by `env/ros_distro` / `env/ros2_distro`
(which previously couldn't use it due to their 4-cell matrix's
cross-axis correlations).

External callers reusing `multi-distro-build-worker.yaml@vX.Y.Z`
break — the `### Changed` entry below carries the full input
migration table. Per-shard GHCR tag shape (`<image_name>-<cell-name>`)
preserved, so registry artifacts produced by existing callers stay
compatible after migration.

RC validation strategy: three caller migration tracking issues
filed against the affected repos (ros1_bridge#108, ros_distro#24,
ros2_distro#23). Each tracking issue carries the exact diff for
that repo's `main.yaml`. RC promotion to formal v0.32.0 happens
after all three caller migration PRs land green against
`@v0.32.0-rc1`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** (#344) — `multi-distro-build-worker.yaml` dispatcher
  rewritten from 1D scalar-axis to N-D `include`-shape matrix-mode.
  Legacy inputs `pr_distros` / `tag_distros` / `distro_input_name` /
  `extra_build_args` are removed; callers must use `pr_matrix` /
  `tag_matrix` (full JSON arrays of `{name, build_args, ...}` entries).
  Each cell's `name` field is REQUIRED and drives both the per-shard
  `image_name` suffix (`<inputs.image_name>-<matrix.name>`, hyphen
  per #339 v0.29.1 convention) and the buildx cache scope
  (`cache_variant: ${{ matrix.name }}`, #272 contract). `build_args`
  is forwarded verbatim — caller fully owns per-cell args. Motivation:
  the 1D dispatcher cannot represent `env/ros_distro` /
  `env/ros2_distro`'s 4-cell shape (strong cross-axis correlations
  between distro/variant/registry/ubuntu suffix); switching to
  GitHub matrix's native `include` form unlocks both env repos as
  callers and any future N-axis case without dispatcher changes.

  Migration table for the only existing 1D caller (`app/ros1_bridge`):

  | Old (v0.29.x — v0.31.x) | New (v0.32.0+) |
  |---|---|
  | `pr_distros: '["humble"]'` | `pr_matrix: '[{"name":"humble","build_args":"ROS2_DISTRO=humble"}]'` |
  | `tag_distros: '["humble", "jazzy"]'` | `tag_matrix: '[{"name":"humble","build_args":"ROS2_DISTRO=humble"},{"name":"jazzy","build_args":"ROS2_DISTRO=jazzy"}]'` |
  | `distro_input_name: ROS2_DISTRO` | (removed — encoded per-cell in `build_args`) |
  | `extra_build_args: ...` | (removed — append directly in each cell's `build_args` via multi-line) |

  Per-shard GHCR tag shape unchanged (`<image_name>-<cell-name>`),
  so registry artifacts produced by existing callers stay compatible
  after migration. `ci-passed` rollup job unchanged — branch
  protection contexts don't move. Existing inline-matrix callers
  (`env/ros_distro` / `env/ros2_distro`) can now adopt the dispatcher
  for the first time. Test spec
  `multi_distro_build_worker_yaml_spec.bats` rewritten (14 → 16
  tests; new negative assertion verifies the 1D inputs are gone).
  Closes #344.

## [v0.31.0] - 2026-05-15

Promoted from `v0.31.0-rc1` (#363). RC tag CI green: `Self Test`
(with `release` job) + `Release test-tools image to GHCR` both
completed/success. RC validation on `env/ros_distro` (PR
ycpss91255-docker/ros_distro#23, closed without merge per RC
convention) confirmed the wrapper consolidation migration works
across all 4 ROS 1 distro shards (kinetic-ros-base /
kinetic-desktop-full / noetic-ros-base / noetic-desktop-full). One
unrelated `-h` usage-string alignment fix (#366) landed between rc1
and stable and is carried into v0.31.0; details in `### Fixed`
below.

Migration note for downstream consumers: Dockerfiles using
`COPY *.sh /lint/` to lint the wrapper scripts must be updated to
`COPY script/*.sh /lint/` after the v0.31.0 upgrade, because the
wrapper layout no longer keeps `*.sh` at the repo root. The
`/batch-template-upgrade v0.31.0` flow patches active downstream
repos automatically via `.claude/scripts/fix-dockerfile-copy-script.sh`;
external consumers must patch their Dockerfiles manually. Surfaced
during RC validation on `env/ros_distro` (commit `32624a3` on the
closed RC PR).

### Fixed

- `build.sh -h` / `run.sh -h` usage strings (all 4 languages — en /
  zh-TW / zh-CN / ja) claimed pre-#88 "warn on drift" semantics that
  were superseded by #88's auto-apply behavior (`build.sh:453-477` /
  `run.sh:442-456` already call `setup.sh apply` automatically when
  `setup.sh check-drift` reports drift). Help text now describes the
  default as auto-regeneration of `.env` + `compose.yaml` when
  `setup.conf` / Dockerfile stages / GPU / GUI / USER_UID change, and
  clarifies that `-s` is for forcing a rerun (opens the TUI on an
  interactive TTY, otherwise non-interactive apply). Two new smoke
  tests in `test/smoke/script_help.bats` lock the new phrasing
  (`auto-regenerate` present, `warn on drift` absent) for both
  scripts. Closes #365.

## [v0.31.0-rc1] - 2026-05-15

Release Candidate for v0.31.0 minor feature release. Bundles a single
breaking change: **#330 wrapper consolidation + Makefile UX overhaul**
(merged via #359). The seven user-facing wrappers move from the
downstream repo root into a `script/` subfolder; `Makefile` stays at
the root as the elevated user-facing entry, rewritten as a 1:1
forwarder with `--` separator for flags. Migration is automatic via
`make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=v0.31.0-rc1` (or
`./.base/upgrade.sh v0.31.0-rc1`) — `init.sh`'s `_create_symlinks`
loop drops the seven legacy root symlinks and creates `script/<name>.sh`
equivalents.

External callers hardcoding `./build.sh` / `./run.sh` / etc. break —
the `### Changed` section below carries the full migration table.

RC validation strategy: `/batch-template-upgrade v0.31.0-rc1 --only
env/ros_distro` opens a single downstream PR; manual verification on
`env/ros_distro` confirms (a) old root symlinks gone, (b) `script/*.sh`
present, (c) `./script/build.sh test` / `make build test` green, (d)
`make build -- --no-cache test` flag forwarding works, (e) `make help`
lists 10 targets without `test` / `runtime` / `run-detach`. RC promotion
to formal v0.31.0 happens after ros_distro validation passes.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** (#330) — wrapper consolidation: the seven user-facing wrappers (`build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh` / `prune.sh` / `setup.sh` / `setup_tui.sh`) move from the downstream repo root into a `script/` subfolder. `Makefile` stays at the root as the elevated user-facing entry. `init.sh` produces the new layout on fresh repos and migrates existing repos automatically (the stale-root-removal loop in `_create_symlinks` drops the seven legacy root symlinks plus the pre-rename `tui.sh`). `upgrade.sh` calls `init.sh` after the subtree pull, so `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=v0.31.0` (or `./.base/upgrade.sh v0.31.0`) is the one-shot migration trigger for downstream consumers. The Dockerfile-level `script/entrypoint.sh` already lived under `script/` and coexists with the new wrappers. External callers hardcoding `./build.sh` / `./run.sh` / etc. break — migration table below.

- **BREAKING** (#330) — Makefile rewrite: the user-facing `.base/script/docker/Makefile` is rewritten to a 1:1 wrapper Makefile with positional-argument forwarding via `$(filter-out $@,$(MAKECMDGOALS))` and a `%:` catch-all rule. Net effect: `make build test` now forwards `test` to `./script/build.sh test` (positional sub-cmds align with `.sh` calling convention); flags require the `--` separator (`make build -- --no-cache test` -> `./script/build.sh --no-cache test`) because Make's argument parser consumes `-` / `--` tokens before `MAKECMDGOALS` is computed. The previously-existing sub-cmd targets `test` / `runtime` / `run-detach` are removed in favour of the positional forwarding pattern. Three new targets ship: `prune` / `setup` / `setup-tui`. `.DEFAULT_GOAL := help` flips the bare-`make` default from "build" to "print help" for better discoverability. `Makefile.ci` is unchanged — the user-facing vs CI-facing split is intentional and preserved (CI keeps using `make -f Makefile.ci test` / `lint` / `upgrade VERSION=vX.Y.Z`).

  Migration table for external consumers:

  | Old | New |
  |---|---|
  | `./build.sh` | `make build` (no args) or `./script/build.sh` |
  | `./build.sh test` | `make build test` or `./script/build.sh test` |
  | `./build.sh --no-cache test` | `make build -- --no-cache test` or `./script/build.sh --no-cache test` |
  | `./run.sh -d` | `make run -- -d` or `./script/run.sh -d` |
  | `./exec.sh -t bats-src bash` | `make exec -- -t bats-src bash` or `./script/exec.sh -t bats-src bash` |
  | `make test` (removed) | `make build test` (positional forward to `./script/build.sh test`) |
  | `make runtime` (removed) | `make build runtime` |
  | `make run-detach` (removed) | `make run -- -d` |
  | `make` (was: build) | `make` now prints help (`.DEFAULT_GOAL := help`); use `make build` to build |

  New tests cover the 1:1 invocation, positional forwarding, `--` separator, `.DEFAULT_GOAL`, and catch-all behaviour (NEW `test/unit/makefile_user_spec.bats`, ~25 cases) plus the `script/` symlink layout + migration loop (`test/integration/init_new_repo_spec.bats` +3 cases, `test/unit/init_spec.bats` updates + 1 new migration case).

## [v0.30.0] - 2026-05-14

Promoted from `v0.30.0-rc1` (#360). rc1 tag CI green: `Self Test` +
`Release test-tools image to GHCR` both completed/success. Bundles
all rc1 content; no further changes between rc1 and stable.

Downstream propagation queued separately:

- `/batch-template-upgrade v0.30.0` against the 2 active consumers
  (`env/ros_distro` + `env/ros2_distro`) when ready. Nothing in
  v0.30.0 is breaking for them — `local_path` defaults to empty,
  `_entrypoint_logging.sh` is opt-in via a one-line source, the
  three new `setup.sh apply` CLI flags are net-additive.
- 9 downstream repos with a `runtime` stage (`app/*` + `env/*`)
  may optionally add the `_entrypoint_logging.sh` source line to
  `script/entrypoint.sh` to unlock host-side `local_path` tee'ing.
  Tracked as separate per-repo PRs rather than batched, since
  some repos have non-standard entrypoints.

## [v0.30.0-rc1] - 2026-05-14

Release Candidate for v0.30.0 minor feature release. Bundles the
`[logging]` UX completion + setup.sh per-invocation CLI flags since
v0.29.2 (four PRs total):

- **#328 `[logging]` UX completion** — two-part fix closing the orphan
  documented in the issue body. Part 1 (#355) made the section
  reachable from the `setup.sh` CLI subcommands and the TUI Runtime
  menu, with first-class per-service editing for `devel` / `test` /
  `runtime`. Part 2 (#356) added the `local_path` key + a new
  `script/docker/_entrypoint_logging.sh` helper, so a single
  `local_path = ./logs/` opt-in now produces a host-side log file
  that `tail -f` / `grep` reaches while `docker logs <container>`
  keeps working unchanged.

- **#338 setup.sh CLI flags** (#357) — three per-invocation overrides
  on `setup.sh apply` (forwarded by `build.sh` / `run.sh`):
  `--gui auto|force|off` overrides `[gui] mode` for one invocation
  (resolution order CLI > `SETUP_GUI` env > setup.conf > default);
  `--no-x11-cookie` skips the SSH X11 cookie rewrite (debug knob
  for the #321 / #333 SSH X11 work); `--print-resolved` dumps the
  resolved state to stdout as `KEY=VALUE` lines without writing
  `.env` / `compose.yaml` / `.gitignore` (subsumes the dry-run
  piece of the #230 base-mcp `setup_resolve` plan).

- **Log INFO visual fix** (#358) — `_log_info` no longer wraps the
  `[<tag>] INFO:` prefix in `\033[2m` dim ANSI. User-feedback
  driven: WARNING (yellow) and ERROR (red bold) keep their bright
  styles, but INFO is informational and should share the default
  terminal colour with the unstyled summary lines that callers
  print alongside it (e.g. setup.sh's `USER=...` summary).

No breaking changes from v0.29.2. `[logging] local_path` defaults to
empty so existing repos see zero compose diff on `make upgrade`; the
new `_entrypoint_logging.sh` helper is opt-in via a one-line source
in each repo's `script/entrypoint.sh` — repos that don't add it see
no behaviour change. The three new `setup.sh apply` flags are
additive; default behaviour is unchanged.

Downstream propagation: `/batch-template-upgrade v0.30.0` fanout
deferred to after the v0.30.0 stable tag lands. The 9 repos with a
`runtime` stage need separate per-repo PRs to add the entrypoint
source-line to unlock `local_path` tee'ing — tracked separately
as repo-level opt-ins.

### Changed

- `script/docker/lib/log.sh`: `_log_info` no longer dims the `[<tag>] INFO:` prefix with `\033[2m`. Users running `./build.sh` / `./run.sh` saw three different visual weights for back-to-back log lines — `[setup] WARNING:` in yellow, `[setup] INFO: .env + compose.yaml updated` dimmed, and the trailing `[setup] USER=... GPU=... GUI=...` summary at full default colour — even though all three belong to the same scope and the summary line shares no `INFO` keyword to justify dimming. After this change INFO matches the summary line's visual weight (default terminal colour), while WARNING (yellow) and ERROR (red bold) keep their bright styles because those levels exist precisely to draw the eye. Test in `log_spec.bats` updated: `_log_info with FORCE_COLOR=1 still emits plain` replaces the prior `emits dim ANSI on non-TTY stdout` test.

### Added

- `script/docker/setup.sh`, `script/docker/build.sh`, `script/docker/run.sh`: three new per-invocation CLI flags so users can toggle GUI / SSH X11 cookie / inspection state without editing `setup.conf` (closes #338). `--gui auto|force|off` (also `--gui=force` short-form) overrides the `[gui] mode` setting for one apply — resolution order is CLI > `SETUP_GUI` env > setup.conf > default. `--no-x11-cookie` keeps GUI enabled but skips the SSH X11 cookie rewrite path (#321 / #333 debug knob — `$XAUTHORITY` stays at whatever the SSH session populated). `--print-resolved` runs all detection + resolution and prints the effective state to stdout as `KEY=VALUE` lines (one per line) then exits without writing `.env` / `compose.yaml` / `.gitignore` — subsumes the dry-run piece of the #230 base-mcp `setup_resolve` plan. The wrapper trio (`build.sh` + `run.sh`) accumulate `--gui` / `--no-x11-cookie` in `SETUP_FORWARD_ARGS` and forward them into the eventual `setup.sh apply` invocation; per-invocation overrides bypass the TUI (which would persist them to setup.conf — wrong semantics for a one-off debug knob). 9 new bats tests in `setup_spec.bats` covering: print-resolved baseline + CLI override flip; invalid value rejection; `--print-resolved` writes nothing; `--gui` override propagates through print-resolved; `X11_COOKIE_SKIP=1` recorded when `--no-x11-cookie` passed; default `X11_COOKIE_SKIP=0`; `SETUP_GUI` env var path; CLI > env precedence.

- `script/docker/setup.sh`, `script/docker/setup_tui.sh`, new `script/docker/_entrypoint_logging.sh`: `[logging] local_path` host-side log file mount (part 2 of #328 — completes the orphan fix shipped earlier this cycle). When `local_path` is set (global or per-service), `setup.sh apply` emits two compose changes on each affected service: (a) a bind mount `<resolved>:/var/log/<repo>` under `volumes:` so the host directory is visible inside the container, and (b) a `LOG_FILE_PATH=/var/log/<repo>/<svc>.log` env var under `environment:`. Path semantics: relative paths resolve against repo root (`./logs/` → `<repo>/logs`); absolute paths pass through verbatim (`/srv/app/`); `~/dir/` expands to `$HOME/dir`; empty value disables the feature (default — back-compat). The new `_entrypoint_logging.sh` helper, sourced from each repo's `script/entrypoint.sh`, reads `LOG_FILE_PATH` and rebinds the shell's stdout/stderr through `tee` so the file gets populated AND `docker logs <container>` continues to show identical content. The helper is a no-op when `LOG_FILE_PATH` is unset, so downstream repos can adopt the source-line unconditionally without breaking repos that haven't opted into `local_path`. Failure modes are warn-and-continue (read-only target, missing `tee`, target is a directory) so a misconfigured `local_path` never blocks container startup. `setup.sh apply` additionally appends relative `local_path` values to the repo's `.gitignore` under a `# managed by template: [logging] local_path` marker (absolute / `~` paths are skipped — those live outside the repo; idempotent re-runs don't churn the file). 24 new bats tests (12 in `compose_logging_spec.bats` covering volume + env emit / per-svc routing / absolute path pass-through / no-op when key absent / gitignore-sync 6 branches; 4 in `setup_spec.bats` covering CLI set / per-svc set / validator rejection of whitespace; 2 in `tui_spec.bats` covering `_validate_log_local_path` accept + reject; 6 in the new `entrypoint_logging_spec.bats` covering tee + truncate + parent-dir creation + read-only fallback + stderr capture).

- `script/docker/setup.sh`, `script/docker/setup_tui.sh`: `[logging]` is now reachable from the CLI subcommands and the TUI Runtime menu, with first-class per-service editing for the three baseline services (`devel` / `test` / `runtime`) — closes part 1 of #328 (the orphan fix; the new `local_path` key + entrypoint tee helper ship as a follow-up). Background: #310 / #314 added `[logging]` to the compose-emit path (`_collect_logging` / `_emit_logging_block` in `setup.sh`) but neither `setup_tui.sh` nor the CLI subcommand dispatcher (`set` / `show` / `list` / `remove`) learned about the section, so users could only configure log driver / rotation by hand-editing `setup.conf`. This PR adds: `_setup_known_section` recognises `logging` and `logging.<svc>` (shape `logging.?*` rejects the trailing-dot edge case); `_setup_set` / `_setup_show` / `_setup_remove` split specs of the form `logging.<svc>.<key>` on the rightmost dot so the per-service section name is preserved; `_setup_validate_kv` enforces the four global / per-service keys via new validators in `_tui_conf.sh` (`_validate_log_driver` — name shape, `_validate_log_max_size` — `<num>[b|k|m|g]`, `_validate_log_max_file` — positive integer, `_validate_log_compress` — `true` / `false`; empty values fall through as "clear key"); `setup_tui.sh` ships a two-level menu — top level picks scope (Global / Per-service: devel / Per-service: test / Per-service: runtime), inner level edits the four scalar keys via the shared `_edit_logging_keys <section>` helper — with i18n labels + error messages across all 4 languages. Inherit-from-global values show as `(inherit)` in per-service menus so it's visible at a glance which keys are overridden vs falling through to global. 21 new bats tests (9 in `setup_spec.bats` covering CLI round-trips + validator surfacing, 7 in `tui_spec.bats` covering the four validators directly, 5 in `tui_flow.bats` covering Runtime-menu dispatch + per-service scope routing).

- `upgrade.sh`: auto-patch downstream Dockerfile lint stage to add `COPY .base/script/docker/lib /lint/lib` + extend `RUN shellcheck` to cover `/lint/lib/*.sh` on first upgrade after #284 (closes #348). Every fanout cycle since v0.27.0 has tripped on 12 of 13 downstream Dockerfiles failing CI with `/lint/lib/log.sh: No such file or directory` because the umbrella loader (`_lib.sh`) source-chains into `lib/{log,env,conf,compose,config_summary,gitignore}.sh` but the stock `COPY .base/script/docker/*.sh /lint/` doesn't recurse into the `lib/` subdirectory. The auto-patch detects the missing COPY line and the stock `RUN shellcheck -S warning /lint/*.sh` anchor, then sed-inserts the COPY line and extends the shellcheck invocation. Idempotent (no-op when the COPY line is already present); skips with a warning when the Dockerfile uses a custom shape (no stock anchor); skips cleanly when no Dockerfile is at the repo root (subtree-only consumer repos). Patched changes ride on the existing `chore: update template references to vX.Y.Z` commit. Eliminates the recurring `fix-dockerfile-lint-lib.sh` post-fanout cleanup workflow used through v0.28.2.

## [v0.29.2] - 2026-05-14

Patch release bundling 4 small-bug closures since v0.29.1: #334 (Dockerfile.example WORKDIR collapse), #335 (exec.sh -t non-devel precheck), #341 (stop.sh skips profile-gated services), #345 (stop.sh -v no-op). No breaking changes from v0.29.1. Per CLAUDE.md's "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH = bug fix; RC not required" rule, tagged directly on the merge commit.

The #334 and #335 entries below were originally drafted into [Unreleased] when their respective PRs (#350 / #351) landed, but a rebase conflict-resolution mistake during the v0.29.1 -> v0.29.2 cycle placed them under the already-tagged [v0.29.1] heading. Moved here for accuracy: those fixes shipped in v0.29.2, not v0.29.1.

### Fixed

- `dockerfile/Dockerfile.example`: add explicit `ENV HOME="/home/${USER_NAME}"` after the `USER` directive in the `devel` stage. `WORKDIR` is a Docker directive that interpolates only build-time `ARG` / `ENV`, not shell-time `$HOME`, so without this the `WORKDIR "${HOME}/work"` directive on the next line silently collapsed to `WORKDIR /work`. Effects: BuildKit emitted `WARN: UndefinedVar: Usage of undefined variable '$HOME'` on every build; `docker inspect <image> --format '{{.Config.WorkingDir}}'` returned `/work` instead of `/home/<user>/work`; non-interactive `docker exec` without `--workdir` landed in `/work` instead of the workspace mount. Interactive `./exec.sh` paths were unaffected because bash resets `$HOME` from the passwd entry, masking the bug. The same `ENV HOME` was added to the commented runtime-stage example (line ~373) for consistency. New integration test in `init_new_repo_spec.bats` asserts the `ENV HOME` appears before the `WORKDIR "${HOME}/work"` directive. Closes #334.

- `script/docker/exec.sh`: precheck for "is the target container running?" now derives the container name from `-t/--target` instead of hardcoding the `devel`-flavoured name. Before this fix the precheck at line 299 was `${USER_NAME}-${IMAGE_NAME}${INSTANCE_SUFFIX}` regardless of target, so any `./exec.sh -t <non-devel> ...` invocation against a running `headless` / `gui` / `test` stage container (auto-emitted via #215 with `container_name: ${USER_NAME}-${IMAGE_NAME}-<stage>${INSTANCE_SUFFIX:-}`) aborted with "'<image>' is not running" even though `docker compose exec ${TARGET}` would have worked. The fix mirrors the compose.yaml convention: `devel` -> no stage suffix, anything else -> `-${TARGET}` suffix between `${IMAGE_NAME}` and `${INSTANCE_SUFFIX}`. 4 new unit cases in `exec_sh_spec.bats` lock the precheck name shape across all four combinations (devel / non-devel x with-instance / without-instance). Closes #335.

- `script/docker/stop.sh`: `_down_one` now exports `COMPOSE_PROFILES='*'` (compose v2.32+ wildcard) and passes `--remove-orphans` when invoking `docker compose down`. Without these, profile-gated services (the auto-emitted `headless` / `gui` / `test` stages introduced via #215) were silently skipped because `docker compose down` only acts on services in currently-active profiles; running `./run.sh -t headless -d` started the container correctly, but `./stop.sh` left it running with no output and `exit 0`. `--remove-orphans` additionally reclaims containers from prior compose.yaml shapes the current file no longer declares. The same env + flag pair is threaded through every `_down_one` invocation (default, `--instance`, `--all`). 2 new unit cases in `stop_sh_spec.bats` lock the `--remove-orphans` propagation including across `--all`. Closes #341.

- `script/docker/stop.sh`: `-v` / `--verbose` is no longer a no-op. Previously it only exported `BUILDKIT_PROGRESS=plain`, which has zero effect on `compose down` because compose down doesn't build anything; the flag accepted, produced no extra output, and users were left confused. The new behaviour lists the containers belonging to the compose project (name + state, via `docker ps -a --filter "label=com.docker.compose.project=<name>"`) before tearing them down, giving the stop flow a real visible signal in parity with `build.sh -v` / `run.sh -v` / `exec.sh -v`. When no containers match, an explicit "No containers found for project &lt;name&gt;" line is printed instead. `-vv` continues to add `set -x` wrapper trace on top. 3 new unit cases in `stop_sh_spec.bats` cover the populated / empty / default (no -v) output. Usage text updated in all 4 languages. Closes #345.

## [v0.29.1] - 2026-05-14

Patch release (no RC) correcting the v0.29.0 dispatcher's per-shard `image_name` separator from `_` to `-` before any downstream adoption. Per CLAUDE.md's "MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH = bug fix; RC not required" rule (see v0.12.1 / v0.12.2 / v0.12.3 precedent), tagged directly on the merge commit.

### Fixed

- `.github/workflows/multi-distro-build-worker.yaml`: per-shard `image_name` separator changed from `_` (v0.29.0) to `-` to match the existing org convention. `app/ros1_bridge`'s pre-dispatcher `main.yaml` shipped `ros1_bridge-${distro}` (hyphen); v0.29.0's initial dispatcher used `_${distro}` (underscore) which would have forced a registry tag rename on adoption. No consumer had adopted v0.29.0's dispatcher yet — this fix corrects the separator before the first downstream migration (planned for `app/ros1_bridge`). `env/ros{,2}_distro` use a single-image-multi-variant shape (no distro suffix on image_name) that this 1D dispatcher doesn't fit; their migration is tracked at #344 (2D dispatcher extension).

## [v0.29.0] - 2026-05-14

Promoted from `v0.29.0-rc1` (#343). rc1 tag CI green: `Self Test` + `Release test-tools image to GHCR` both completed/success. The `:main` rolling tag bootstrapped on the rc1 multi-arch publish.

Bundles all rc1 content; no further changes between rc1 and stable.

Downstream propagation queued separately:

- `app/ros1_bridge` — migrate `main.yaml` to use `multi-distro-build-worker.yaml@v0.29.0` (1D matrix; B-1 ready as-shipped).
- `env/ros_distro` + `env/ros2_distro` — defer until base#344 ships the 2D dispatcher extension (distro × variant).
- 13 single-target downstream repos — `/batch-template-upgrade v0.29.0` when ready; nothing in v0.29.0 is breaking for them.

## [v0.29.0-rc1] - 2026-05-14

Release Candidate for v0.29.0 minor feature release. Bundles two themes since v0.28.2:

- **#317 self-test CI optimization plan completed** — all four P-phases shipped: P1 (#318, buildx GHA cache + doc-only classifier; pre-session) + P1 follow-up (#329, classifier fail-open + base ref fetch for fork PRs) + P2 (#332 + #336 hotfix, `:main` rolling tag with 3-layer Obtain fallback + integration-e2e env passthrough + paths-filtered main-push trigger on release-test-tools.yaml) + P3 (#342, `behavioural` job tightened to `behavioural_relevant` gate + block-list extended with `setup.sh` / `i18n.sh` / `lib/**` / `prune.sh`). Net effect: typical PR shaves ~3-5 min wall-time; doc-only PRs land in seconds with `test` short-circuited and `integration-e2e` / `behavioural` skipped; bootstrap-window of fresh `:main` tag absorbed by the 3-layer fallback.

- **#325 B-1 dispatcher reusable workflow** (#339) — new `.github/workflows/multi-distro-build-worker.yaml` lets multi-distro callers (`app/ros1_bridge`, eventually `env/ros_distro` and `env/ros2_distro` after 2D extension lands) pass `pr_distros` / `tag_distros` JSON-array inputs plus a `distro_input_name`. The dispatcher resolves the per-event distro subset and fans it across `build-worker.yaml` matrix shards with a `ci-passed` rollup matching CLAUDE.md's status-check table contract. Replaces the previous "copy-paste the `github.event_name == 'pull_request' && fromJSON(...) || fromJSON(...)` expression into every multi-distro main.yaml" pattern (Path A, rejected per locked decision).

Plus a documentation clarification (#331) on the v0.28.1 `${USER_NAME}-` container_name prefix's relationship to `${DOCKER_HUB_USER}` / `INSTANCE_SUFFIX` namespacing.

No breaking changes from v0.28.2. All changes are internal CI plumbing or net-additive reusable workflow surfaces; downstream Dockerfile contracts and `build-worker.yaml` / `release-worker.yaml` input signatures unchanged.

Downstream propagation is partial in this release: the B-1 dispatcher consumer migrations (`app/ros1_bridge`) follow as separate PRs after v0.29.0 stable lands. `env/*_distro` migrations defer to the 2D-matrix dispatcher extension tracked separately.

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/self-test.yaml`: `behavioural` job's job-level `if:` tightens from `needs.classify.outputs.code_changed == 'true'` to `needs.classify.outputs.behavioural_relevant == 'true'` (#317 P3). P1 already emitted the narrower `behavioural_relevant` output but routed only `code_changed` to the `behavioural` gate; P3 wires the existing output to its intended consumer so PRs that change pure lint / unit-test / Codecov-relevant paths (covered by `test`) no longer burn the docker.sock-mounted compose run. The `classify` job's behavioural block-list is extended with `script/docker/setup.sh` + `script/docker/i18n.sh` + `script/docker/lib/**` + `script/docker/prune.sh` (#317 gotcha-5): each affects `.env` / `compose.yaml` generation or wrapper behaviour that the behavioural compose service exercises end-to-end, so changes there must invalidate the behavioural-skip optimization. Closes the last P-phase of #317.

### Added

- `.github/workflows/multi-distro-build-worker.yaml`: new dispatcher reusable workflow (#325 B-1). Multi-distro callers (`env/ros_distro`, `env/ros2_distro`, `app/ros1_bridge`) pass `pr_distros` / `tag_distros` JSON-array inputs plus a `distro_input_name`; the dispatcher resolves the per-event distro subset (`pull_request` -> `pr_distros`; everything else -> `tag_distros`) and fans the subset across `build-worker.yaml` matrix shards. Each shard derives `image_name` as `<image_name>_<distro>`, passes `<distro_input_name>=<distro>` as the first build_args line, and shards buildx GHA cache via `cache_variant: ${{ matrix.distro }}` (#272 contract reuse). A `ci-passed` rollup job satisfies branch protection — same name used by env/ros_distro / env/ros2_distro per CLAUDE.md's status-check table, so downstream protection contexts don't change on adoption. Solves the maintenance drift caused by the previous "copy-paste the `github.event_name == 'pull_request' && fromJSON('[...]') || fromJSON('[...]')` expression into every multi-distro `main.yaml`" pattern (#325 Path A, explicitly rejected in favour of B-1 dispatcher per the locked decision).

## [v0.28.2] - 2026-05-14

Patch release for SSH X11 forwarding follow-up (#321 hotfix #333) bundled with CI infrastructure improvements (#317 P2 rolling `:main` tag + 3-layer Obtain fallback, #336 integration-e2e driver fix, #317 P1 follow-up classify-job hardening) and documentation clarifying the v0.28.1 naming-scheme change (#322 follow-up). No breaking changes from v0.28.1; users on v0.28.1 should upgrade to pick up the SSH X11 fix (the v0.28.1 cookie-rewrite path silently produced empty cookies under common `~/.Xauthority` lock contention).

### Fixed

- `setup.sh::_setup_ssh_x11_cookie`: SSH X11 cookie rewrite silently produced a 0-byte `.docker.xauth` when `~/.Xauthority` was held by another process (tmux session, ssh-agent, DE startup hook holding flock). `xauth nlist` printed `error in locking authority file` to stderr (swallowed by `2>/dev/null` in the pipe) and exited 0 with empty stdout; the downstream `sed` + `xauth nmerge` chain inherited the empty input, nmerge wrote 0 bytes, the whole pipe returned 0, and the function happily echoed the cookie path back to `write_env`. The .env then carried `XAUTHORITY=<repo>/.docker.xauth` pointing at an empty file → container mounted a 0-byte cookie → libX11 had no token to present → `Can't open display: localhost:N` inside the container, even though every layer reported success. Two-part hotfix:
  - Pass `-i` (ignore-locks) to both `xauth nlist` (read) and `xauth -f ... nmerge` (write). The lockfile contention is on `~/.Xauthority` itself; `-i` bypasses the lock guard, which is safe for read and acceptable for the dedicated `.docker.xauth` target file (single writer).
  - Defensive empty-file check (`[[ ! -s "${_out}" ]]`) after the pipe — if the rewrite produced no bytes despite the pipe returning 0, log a warning and return non-zero so the caller falls back to leaving `XAUTHORITY` unset in .env rather than emitting an empty-cookie path. Existing host XAUTHORITY then flows through unchanged (still won't fix the hostname-keyed cookie problem for SSH X11, but no more silent breakage on top).
  - Follow-up to #321 (#324). Tests: existing positive-path test updated to assert `-i` flag in the captured argv; new negative-path test asserts the empty-cookie defensive branch returns 1 with the expected warning.

### Documentation

- `README.md` + `doc/readme/README.{zh-TW,zh-CN,ja}.md`: new "Naming scheme: three namespaces, two user identities" subsection under "Per-repo runtime configuration". Clarifies why `image:` uses `${DOCKER_HUB_USER}` (registry-side namespace, breaks cache reuse if per-OS-user) while `container_name:` uses `${USER_NAME}` (host daemon namespace, the actual collision class #322 fixes), and why compose project name kept `${DOCKER_HUB_USER}` historically — together with a worked example contrasting single-user-machine alignment vs. multi-user-host divergence. Also documents `INSTANCE_SUFFIX` as the fourth orthogonal dimension for same-user same-repo parallel containers. No behaviour change; the #322 CHANGELOG entry's "aligns container-level naming with project-level naming" phrasing is now self-explanatory for sysadmins where OS user and Docker Hub user diverge.

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/release-test-tools.yaml`: add a `:main` rolling tag (#317 P2). New `push.branches: [main]` trigger with a `paths:` filter (gotcha 3) restricting to commits that actually touch `dockerfile/Dockerfile.test-tools` or this workflow itself — doc-only / shell-only merges no longer churn GHCR. The `Resolve tags` step now branches three ways: tag push -> `:<ver>` + `:latest`; main push -> `:main`; `workflow_dispatch` -> `:latest`. A new `smoke` output tracks the trigger's primary tag so the post-publish smoke step pulls what was just pushed (catches `:main` bootstrap bugs that the previous static-`:latest` pull would have missed).

- `.github/workflows/self-test.yaml`: each of the 3 downstream jobs (`test`, `integration-e2e`, `behavioural`) gains an `Obtain test-tools:local` step before its existing buildx build (#317 P2). The Obtain step implements a 3-layer fallback — (1) PR touched `dockerfile/Dockerfile.test-tools` -> rebuild local; (2) try `docker pull ghcr.io/ycpss91255-docker/test-tools:main` and re-tag as `test-tools:local`; (3) pull failed -> fall through to local rebuild. For `test` + `behavioural` (which run via `docker compose run`, not `compose build`), the buildx build step gates on `steps.obtain.outputs.build_local == 'true'` so the hot path (pulled `:main`) skips the rebuild and reuses the GHA cache scope from P1 on the cold path. For `integration-e2e` (which runs `./build.sh test` -> `docker compose build`, whose `FROM ${TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE}` resolves against the host docker daemon), the buildx `driver: docker` override is preserved and the rebuild fallback is inlined as plain `docker build`; GHA cache is not available on this driver, accepted because the hot path is `docker pull :main` and cold path matches pre-P2 cost. `integration-e2e` additionally passes `TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE: test-tools:local` to `./build.sh test` so the wrapper skips its own internal test-tools build, reusing the image populated by the Obtain step. Each Obtain step also pre-fetches the base ref via `git fetch origin "${BASE_REF}:refs/remotes/origin/${BASE_REF}" --depth=200 || true`, reusing the P1 follow-up gotcha-2 mitigation for fork PRs.

- `script/docker/build.sh`: skip the internal `docker build -t test-tools:local` step when `TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE` env is set (#317 P2). Callers that pre-build or pin the test-tools image (CI self-test workflow's Obtain step; downstream build-worker / publish-worker pinning to `:<version>`) signal "I have my own provisioning" via this env, and `build.sh`'s internal wrapper build becomes wasted work. The caller is responsible for ensuring the referenced image is resolvable by `Dockerfile.example`'s `FROM ${TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE} AS test-tools-stage` — either locally tagged or registry-addressable. Pre-#317 P2 behaviour preserved when the env is unset.

- `.github/workflows/self-test.yaml`: harden `classify` job against latent fail-closed and fork-PR breakage (#317 P1 follow-up). The job's required-check chain (`test` needs `classify`) means any non-zero exit here wedges every PR merge (Q4 fail-closed design). Two robustness changes: (1) `set -uo pipefail` instead of `set -euo pipefail` so transient diff/fetch errors fall through the `if git diff --quiet` form to the existing "differences exist" branch (emits `code_changed=true` / `behavioural_relevant=true` rather than aborting the job); (2) explicit `git fetch origin "${BASE_REF}:refs/remotes/origin/${BASE_REF}" --depth=200 || true` before the diff so fork PRs (where `actions/checkout@v6` `fetch-depth: 0` only fetches the head branch, not the base) don't trip on `origin/<base>` being absent locally. Worst case after this change: a misclassified doc-only PR burns one full-suite run instead of blocking the merge queue.

### Notes

- The first 1-2 self-test runs after #317 P2 merges may take the layer-3 fallback path (local rebuild) because the `:main` rolling tag hasn't been published yet. `release-test-tools.yaml`'s new `push.branches: [main]` trigger fires on the P2 PR's merge and publishes `:main` for the first time — but a self-test triggered in that bootstrap window will see `docker pull :main` fail (404) and fall back to a from-source build with GHA cache. Expected; not a regression.

## [v0.28.1] - 2026-05-14

Patch release bundling 4 closed-issue PRs since v0.28.0: 2 fixes (#322 multi-user container_name collision, #321 SSH X11 forwarding) + 1 feature (#319 prune.sh + stop.sh --prune for docker garbage cleanup) + 1 internal CI improvement (#317 P1 buildx GHA cache + doc-only classifier short-circuit). No new MINOR features; the prune.sh wrapper is opt-in utility tooling consistent with the existing build/run/exec/stop pattern. No breaking changes from v0.28.0 — but #322 has a one-shot orphan-container cleanup caveat (see entry below); existing running instances need a manual `docker stop <name> && docker rm <name>` or `./prune.sh --all` once.

### Added

- `script/docker/prune.sh` (new wrapper): atomic local docker garbage cleanup. Provides `--networks` / `--images` / `--volumes` / `--builder` / `--all` (= networks + images + builder, intentionally excluding volumes), each with conservative per-target `--filter until=<dur>` defaults (`networks=10m`, `images=24h`, `builder=24h`; `volumes` ignores `--filter` because most docker engines do not honor it). `--until <dur>` overrides all selected targets. `--volumes` prompts for confirmation unless `-y/--yes` is passed because volume prune permanently deletes data. Standard wrapper conventions inherited from build/run/exec/stop: `-h/--help` + `--lang` in 4 languages (en/zh-TW/zh-CN/ja), `-C/--chdir` accepted for parity (no-op since prune is daemon-wide), `--dry-run` prints commands without executing. `init.sh` adds `prune.sh` to the symlink list so downstream repos automatically get the wrapper after the next `git subtree pull`. Closes #319 (the issue body documents the "all predefined address pools have been fully subnetted" symptom that motivated this addition).
- `script/docker/stop.sh`: new `--prune` flag — opt-in lightweight cleanup after `compose down`. Runs `docker network prune -f --filter until=10m` (the actual address-pool reclaim path) and `docker image prune -f --filter until=24h` (dangling images from aborted builds). Volumes and buildx cache are intentionally NOT covered here — use `./prune.sh` for those. The flag works alongside `--all` even when no instances are found, so a stale repo with leftover orphans gets reclaimed. Refs #319.

### Fixed

- `setup.sh`: SSH X11 forwarding now works inside containers. When the user is on an `ssh -X` / `ssh -Y` session (detected via `SSH_CONNECTION` + `DISPLAY` matching `localhost:N[.M]`), the X11 authentication cookie is rewritten with the `ffff` "any host" family code via `xauth nlist | sed | xauth nmerge` and written to `<repo>/.docker.xauth`. The rewritten path is then emitted as `XAUTHORITY=` in `.env` so `compose.yaml`'s `${XAUTHORITY:-}` substitution picks it up at runtime; the existing `XAUTHORITY` mount line carries the file into the container. Without this rewrite, `libX11` inside the container looked up the cookie under the container's hostname (a Docker-assigned random) and failed because SSH wrote the cookie keyed to the host's hostname. Additionally, when SSH X11 is detected but `[network] mode != host`, a warning fires pointing the user to switch (`localhost:N` cannot route from a bridge network to the host's SSH X11 listener on `localhost:6010+N`). The fix gracefully degrades when `xauth` is not in `PATH` (logs a warning, leaves `XAUTHORITY` at the host value). `.docker.xauth` joins the canonical `.gitignore` set (now 8 entries, up from 7) so it never enters version control. Closes #321.

- `setup.sh::generate_compose_yaml`: `container_name:` on all 3 emission sites (devel + 2 auto-emitted stage variants) now includes `${USER_NAME}-` prefix so two OS users on the same host can run the same repo concurrently without colliding on Docker's global container-name namespace. Before: `claude_code` (collision). After: `alice-claude_code` / `bob-claude_code`. The compose **project name** (`PROJECT_NAME` from `lib/compose.sh::_compute_project_name`) was already user-prefixed via `DOCKER_HUB_USER`, so this aligns the container-level naming with the project-level naming. `run.sh:486` (`CONTAINER_NAME` runtime check) and `exec.sh:297` (`_container_name` precheck) updated to match. Closes #322. **Caveat for existing users**: after upgrading, the old un-prefixed container (e.g. `claude_code`) still exists but is unreachable by `./run.sh` / `./exec.sh` (they look for `${USER_NAME}-claude_code` now). Run `docker stop <old-name> && docker rm <old-name>` once, or `./prune.sh --all` once leftover containers stop, to reclaim.

### Changed

- `.github/workflows/self-test.yaml`: P1 of the CI optimization plan (#317). New `classify` job emits two outputs from a pure-shell `git diff` against `origin/${base_ref}`: `code_changed` (false when the PR touches only `doc/**` + `README.md` + `LICENSE`) and `behavioural_relevant` (false when the PR does not touch the behavioural block-list — `script/entrypoint.sh`, `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile.example`, `Dockerfile.test-tools`, the four `script/docker/{build,run,exec,stop}.sh` wrappers, `init.sh`, `upgrade.sh`, `test/behavioural/**`, `.github/workflows/**`). Non-PR events (push to main / tag / workflow_dispatch) short-circuit to `true` on both outputs so post-merge and release builds run the full suite. Same pure-shell classifier pattern as #273 Phase 2's build-worker.yaml — no third-party GHA action dependency. The `test` job (only branch-protection-required check) keeps the job slot in the graph but short-circuits to SUCCESS in ~5-10s on doc-only PRs; `integration-e2e` + `behavioural` use job-level `if:` to skip entirely on doc-only PRs (they are not required checks). P3 will tighten `behavioural`'s gate to `behavioural_relevant` once observed in production for a cycle.
- `.github/workflows/self-test.yaml`: P1 of the CI optimization plan (#317). Three `test-tools:local` builds across the `test` / `behavioural` jobs migrated from `docker build` to `docker/build-push-action@v6` with `cache-from: type=gha,scope=test-tools` + `cache-to: type=gha,scope=test-tools,mode=max`. All three steps share the same cache scope so a warm cache populated by one job is hit by the others within the same workflow run and across subsequent runs (cache key is by Dockerfile content + build context). Hot cache reruns shrink the test-tools build step from ~1-2 min cold to ~10s. The third copy of the build (inside `integration-e2e`'s `./build.sh test` invocation, which calls `docker build` from within the wrapper script) is left untouched in P1; P2 will replace it with a `TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE` env passthrough once the `:main` GHCR rolling tag lands.

## [v0.28.0] - 2026-05-13

Promoted from `v0.28.0-rc1` (#315). rc1 tag CI green: `Self Test` ×2 (test + integration-e2e) + `Release test-tools image to GHCR` ×2 (amd64 + arm64), all completed/success. Downstream RC validation deferred — downstream repos will be upgraded via `/batch-template-upgrade v0.28.0` after this stable tag (skipped the parallel rc1 fanout to keep the cycle short).

Bundles all rc1 content; no further changes between rc1 and stable.

## [v0.28.0-rc1] - 2026-05-13

Release Candidate. Bundles 4 closed-issue PRs since v0.27.0 (#305 actionlint gate, #309 ANSI on config_summary, #310 [logging] section, #311 `-v` flag) plus the long-tail closure of #278.

### Added

- `self-test.yaml`: `actionlint` job (Docker invocation, `rhysd/actionlint:1.7.7` pinned) running before the existing `test` / `integration-e2e` / `behavioural` jobs, which now declare `needs: actionlint`. Catches GHA workflow-validator semantic regressions (e.g. `${{ matrix.X }}` referenced outside a step scope — the class behind the v0.26.0-rc1 wedge fixed by #297) at PR time before bats / docker matrix burns CI minutes. No new third-party GHA action dependency (Docker pull, in line with the #273 Phase 2 "no `dorny/paths-filter` dependency" preference). Closes #305.
- `script/docker/{build,run,exec,stop}.sh`: `-v` / `--verbose` and `-vv` / `--very-verbose` flags. `-v` exports `BUILDKIT_PROGRESS=plain` so a hung `docker build` step's real-time stdout/stderr is visible instead of the collapsed single-line progress UI (the common diagnostic scenario when a build appears stuck and the user cannot tell whether it is doing work, waiting on network, or hung). `-vv` adds `set -x` on the wrapper itself for debugging the wrapper's own option parsing / branching. All four wrappers accept both spellings for muscle-memory consistency, even though `BUILDKIT_PROGRESS` is only meaningful when a build actually happens (build.sh always, run.sh via Compose auto-build; exec.sh / stop.sh accept the flag but it is a no-op there). Usage text in all four languages (en / zh-TW / zh-CN / ja) documents both forms. Closes #311.
- `setup.conf`: new `[logging]` section (`driver` / `max_size` / `max_file` / `compress`) with `json-file` rotation defaults (`10m` × `3` compressed). `setup.sh` now emits a `logging:` mapping on every compose service (`devel` / `test` / any auto-emitted Dockerfile stage), so containers no longer fall back to the daemon-wide default (which is `json-file` with **no rotation** on Ubuntu/Debian hosts — a noisy long-running container could fill the host root partition unbounded). Per-service override via `[logging.<svc>]` does key-level merge on top of `[logging]` (e.g. `[logging.runtime] max_size = 50m` keeps the other three keys at global). Closes #310.

### Changed

- `test/unit/self_test_yaml_spec.bats` (new, 5 tests): structural assertions locking the actionlint gate — job exists + uses pinned `rhysd/actionlint:x.y.z` Docker image + 3 downstream jobs declare `needs: actionlint`. Aborts CI if a future refactor quietly drops the gate.
- `lib/log.sh`: new `_log_plain <tag> <style> <msg...>` helper for tagged stdout lines that need TTY-aware visual weight (bold / dim) but no level keyword. Reuses the existing `_log_color_enabled` gate so behavior under `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR` / piped stdout matches `_log_err` / `_log_warn` / `_log_info`.
- `lib/config_summary.sh::_print_config_summary`: route the 2 dividers through `_log_plain ... dim` and the 5 section headers (`Files` / `Identity` / `Variables` / `setup.conf` / `Resolved`) through `_log_plain ... bold`. On a TTY the eye lands on structure; piped / `NO_COLOR=1` output is byte-identical to before (the `[<tag>] ` prefix and indented value lines stay unstyled, so grep-based filters on the tag are unaffected). Closes the long tail of #278 (closes #309).
- `test/unit/compose_logging_spec.bats` (new, 13 tests): covers `generate_compose_yaml` logging emission (back-compat empty case, global emit on devel + test + auto-emitted stage, driver-only, partial options, per-svc override + key-level inheritance) plus the two new parser helpers (`_parse_logging_svc_sections` / `_collect_logging`).

### Fixed

- `build-worker.yaml`: surfaced + resolved a pre-existing `SC2002` ("useless cat") in the `Check template version` step's `LOCAL_VER=$(cat .base/.version | tr -d ...)` shell block. Replaced with `tr ... < .base/.version`. Drive-by fix: this was caught the moment the actionlint gate (this PR) ran for the first time — exactly the kind of latent issue actionlint exists to surface.
- `publish-worker.yaml`: removed two orphan job outputs `digest_amd64` / `digest_arm64` that referenced a non-existent `steps.export.outputs.digest_<arch>` (the workflow has `steps.tags` and `steps.push`, never `steps.export`). No consumer reads these outputs anywhere in the org. Latent since the file was added. Drive-by fix surfaced by the actionlint gate added in this PR.

## [v0.27.0] - 2026-05-13

Promoted from `v0.27.0-rc1` (#304). rc1 tag CI green (Self Test + release-test-tools). RC validation pass: all 8 active downstream repos (4 agent + ros1_bridge + urg_node_humble + 2 env multi-distro) merged `chore/template-v0.27.0-rc1` PRs (ai_agent#51, claude_code#50, codex_cli#49, gemini_cli#49, ros1_bridge#90, urg_node_humble#46, ros2_distro#17, ros_distro#17) with CI green on each. The 5 sensor-app repos (realsense_humble / realsense_noetic / sick_humble / sick_noetic / urg_node_noetic) remain on pre-`.base/` v0.24.0 awaiting #263 pip migration; they continue to be deferred from this fanout.

**Validation summary**:
- Workflow validator parse-through: zero `0s "workflow file issue"` failures across all 8 fanout PRs (the v0.26.0-rc1 incident class did not recur — `actionlint` locally before tagging caught any regression risk; #305 will lift this gate into base PR CI).
- #273 Phase 2 shell classifier behavioural parity: every fanout PR correctly fell through to the full matrix (subtree-pull touches `.base/.version` + `main.yaml` `@vX.Y.Z` refs — non-doc paths — so the new shell classifier reports `code_changed=true` identically to Phase 1).
- #272 GHA buildx cache: organic warm-cache validation from the v0.26.0 fanout pair (`ros1_bridge#88` cold ~18m26s → `ros1_bridge#89` warm ~2m17s on the same SHA family) measures **−87.7% wall-time drop**, far exceeding the #272 acceptance criterion of ≥30%.

Bundles all rc1 content; no further changes between rc1 and stable.

## [v0.27.0-rc1] - 2026-05-13

First Release Candidate for v0.27.0. Post-v0.26.0 MINOR bump bundling wrapper UX wins (`exec.sh --` separator / `setup.sh --quiet`) + the `#273 Phase 2` pure-shell rewrite of the doc-only fast-pass classifier (drops the `dorny/paths-filter@v3` dependency for non-GitHub-CI portability) + the `#290` `_setup_msg` i18n refactor (mirrors #278 PR-2 for the setup-side; level keyword goes English-only consistent with #283 design) + the `#291` wrapper UX cheat sheet doc.

**Behavioural changes downstream consumers may notice after this RC**:

- `setup.sh` (and `setup_tui.sh` indirectly) now emits **English level keywords** in script output (`[setup] ERROR:` / `WARNING:` / `INFO:`) even on `zh-TW` / `zh-CN` / `ja` locales. Message body remains localised. Same tradeoff already shipped in v0.26.0 for `build/run/exec/stop`; v0.27.0 extends it to `setup.sh`. Any downstream script doing literal grep for `[setup] WARN:` (note: not `WARNING:`) must update to either the new English keyword or to the i18n body.
- `exec.sh` accepts `--` separator before CMD (mirrors `run.sh`); `exec.sh ls /tmp` keeps working as a positional CMD.
- `setup.sh` mutating subcommands (`set` / `add` / `remove` / `reset`) now print a 3-line confirmation by default; `--quiet` / `-q` suppresses it. `apply` keeps its existing summary line, gated on `--quiet`. The TUI's `_commit_and_setup` passes `--quiet` to `apply` to avoid double-printing after its `[tui] saved` line.
- `setup.sh -h` lists the new `--quiet` flag.
- `build.sh -t / --target TARGET` flag alias already shipped in v0.26.0 (#280); v0.27.0's `README.md` adds the consolidating wrapper UX cheat sheet table (closes #291) so downstream READMEs can link to a single canonical reference instead of duplicating the per-script flag matrix.

**Primary validation target**: any downstream repo whose CI runs the doc-only fast-pass (Phase 1 already validated end-to-end on `base#301`; Phase 2's shell rewrite preserves behaviour and was unit-tested via `build_worker_yaml_spec.bats`). For fanout, every downstream PR opened by `/batch-template-upgrade v0.27.0` exercises the new shell classifier on the first CI run.

Bundles 5 post-v0.26.0 PRs:

- **#299** — `exec.sh --` flag/CMD separator (closes #289)
- **#300** — `setup.sh --quiet` + success confirmation (closes #285)
- **#301** — wrapper UX cheat sheet docs (closes #291)
- **#302** — `#273 Phase 2` pure-shell doc-only classifier
- **#303** — `_setup_msg` per-category split + `_log_*` routing (closes #290)

### Changed
- **`script/docker/_lib.sh` split into focused sub-libs under `script/docker/lib/`** (closes #284). The 313+ line monolith covering log helpers, env loader, compose wrappers, INI parsing, i18n labels, and the config-summary printer splits into 5 single-concern files: `lib/log.sh` (`_log_color_enabled` / `_log_err` / `_log_warn` / `_log_info`), `lib/env.sh` (`_load_env`), `lib/conf.sh` (`_dump_conf_section`), `lib/compose.sh` (`_compute_project_name` / `_compose` / `_compose_project`), `lib/config_summary.sh` (`_lib_msg` + `_print_config_summary`; sources `lib/conf.sh` for `_dump_conf_section`). Each sub-lib has its own `_DOCKER_LIB_<NAME>_SOURCED` guard. `_lib.sh` becomes a thin umbrella that sources `i18n.sh` + all 5 sub-libs in dependency order, so build / run / exec / stop / setup callers keep working unchanged — back-compat is a hard requirement (per the issue body) and pure file-move semantics. Lighter callers (init.sh / upgrade.sh / ci.sh) can later be migrated to source just `lib/log.sh` directly; deferred to a follow-up to keep this PR strictly layout-only. `dockerfile/Dockerfile.example` gains a matching `COPY .base/script/docker/lib /lint/lib` so the /lint/ stage layout mirrors the normal `.base/` layout and `_lib.sh` resolves its `lib/` sources identically in both. The `RUN shellcheck` step extends to `/lint/lib/*.sh`. `script/ci/ci.sh::_run_shellcheck` adds a `find script/docker/lib -name '*.sh'` pass, closing a pre-existing lint gap on `lib/gitignore.sh` (which has lived there since #172 unlinted). 12 test fixtures across `build_sh` / `run_sh` / `exec_sh` / `stop_sh` / `wrapper_lib_lookup` / `setup_spec` / `upgrade_spec` (integration) / `gitignore_sync_spec` / `init_spec` gain a `cp /source/script/docker/lib/*.sh ...` (or symlink-equivalent for `init_spec`) line alongside the existing `_lib.sh` cp so the in-sandbox `_lib.sh` resolves its sub-lib sources. No new tests — pure file-move; existing `lib_spec.bats` (41 tests) sourcing `_lib.sh` (now umbrella) keeps covering the full surface. Total tests stay at 1140.
- **`build-worker.yaml` doc-only PR fast-pass classifier rewritten in pure shell** (#273 Phase 2). The Phase 1 `dorny/paths-filter@v3` dependency is dropped; the classifier is now `git diff --name-only base...head` + a `case` glob with the same 6-path allowlist (`**/*.md`, `doc/**`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/dependabot.yml`). Behaviorally equivalent — same paths trigger fast-pass, same paths trigger full matrix — but the classifier logic is now platform-agnostic shell, leaving only the wrapping YAML + `GITHUB_OUTPUT` line bound to GitHub Actions. Future migration to a non-GitHub CI host (e.g. internal GitLab CI) needs only an adapter shim around the same `case` arm, no rewrite of the allowlist semantics. GitHub-context tokens (`github.event_name`, `github.event.pull_request.base.sha`, `github.event.pull_request.head.sha`) pre-expand into `EVENT_NAME` / `BASE_SHA` / `HEAD_SHA` env vars so the inline shell body uses plain `$base` / `$head` expansion only. Validated by `actionlint` locally before tagging (preventing the rc1-class `${{ matrix.target.name }}` regression). New 4 tests in `test/unit/build_worker_yaml_spec.bats` (31 -> 32; total 1139 -> 1140; unit 1083 -> 1084): no `uses: dorny/paths-filter` import (comments fine), classifier reads SHAs from env, non-PR short-circuit fires before `git diff`, 6-path allowlist in a single `case` arm.
- **`setup.sh` `_setup_msg` split per category + routed through `_log_*`** (closes #290). Mirrors #278 PR-2 (#283) for the wrapper quartet: setup.sh's monolithic `_setup_msg KEY` case statement splits into 6 per-category sub-functions (`_setup_msg_<category>`) over `${_LANG}:${KEY}` joint patterns with a thin dispatcher `_setup_msg <category> <key>`. Categories used: `env` (.env regen status), `errors` (unknown_arg / unknown_subcmd / unknown_section / invalid_value / key_not_found / section_not_found), `warnings` (no_repo_conf / empty_repo_conf), `usage` (per-subcommand short help), `reset` (confirm / aborted / done / needs_yes), `stage` (invalid_format / baseline_collision / reserved_tag / unknown_referenced / override_key_not_allowed). Each case branch strips its old `[setup] <translated level>:` prefix and returns plain i18n body only; level keyword + tag are added by `_log_err` / `_log_warn` / `_log_info` callers — **English-only level keyword** (non-English users now see `[setup] WARNING: <body>` instead of `[setup] WARN: <body>`; the body itself remains localised in zh-TW / zh-CN / ja / en, see #283 design). setup.sh now sources `_lib.sh` (transitive `i18n.sh` source is guarded). Interactive `reset_confirm` prompt, the per-subcommand `usage` strings, and the `[setup] file: ...` / `[setup] next: ...` confirmation hints from #285 keep their direct `printf` / direct-`_setup_msg` shape because they are help text / prompts / structured display, not log lines. The new `_setup_msg KEY` API: 2-arg form `_setup_msg <category> <key>` (was 1-arg `_setup_msg <key>`). `test/unit/setup_spec.bats` assertions updated for the new prefix shape + 2-arg API; 3 sandbox fixtures gain a `cp /source/script/docker/_lib.sh ...` line so the in-sandbox setup.sh can source it. Total tests stay at 1140 (no new tests; existing assertions migrate).

### Documentation
- **Wrapper UX cheat sheet section added to `README.md`** (closes #291). Single canonical reference table for the 5 user-facing scripts (build / run / exec / stop / setup), listing every flag (`-h` / `-C` / `--lang` / `--dry-run` / `-s` / `-t` / `--instance` / `-q` / `--`) plus positional meaning per script. Downstream READMEs link here instead of duplicating the matrix, fixing the docs-drift class where (per #291) the same repo's README ended up using positional in one section and the flag form in another. The section also locks the three design decisions that #291's body left open: (Q1) `build.sh` keeps positional + `-t` / `--target` alias (#280, backwards-compatible); (Q2) `stop.sh` does NOT grow `-t` — it stays project-wide `docker compose down`, since per-service stop has different docker semantics; (Q3) `setup.sh` CLI stays subcommand-first verb-style. Rolls up #280 (already shipped) + #289 (shipped) + #285 (shipped) under the unifying narrative.

### Added
- **`setup.sh` mutating subcommands print success confirmation + `--quiet` / `-q` flag for scripted callers** (closes #285). Previously `set` / `add` / `remove` (and to a lesser extent `reset` / `apply`) succeeded silently from the CLI, leaving the user with no signal that the mutation was accepted, which file changed, or that `./setup.sh apply` is the explicit next step. Now `set` / `add` / `remove` / `reset` print a 3-line confirmation on success — `[setup] <verb> [<section>] <key>[ = <value>]`, `[setup] file: <path>`, `[setup] next: run './setup.sh apply' to regenerate .env + compose.yaml`. `apply`'s existing `env_done` + `USER=... GPU=... GUI=... IMAGE=... WS=...` summary is unchanged. All 5 subcommands accept `--quiet` / `-q` to suppress the confirmation lines while keeping errors on stderr. `setup_tui.sh`'s `_commit_and_setup` passes `--quiet` to its `setup.sh apply` invocation (3 call sites) so the TUI's existing `[tui] saved` line is not doubled by `apply`'s summary. Mutation still writes the value under `--quiet`. New tests in `test/unit/setup_spec.bats` (11 tests; total 1128 -> 1139; unit 1072 -> 1083): set / add / remove default 3-line confirmation + `--quiet` empty stdout + `-q` short form + `--quiet` still mutates the file; reset default 3-line confirmation + `--quiet` empty stdout; apply `--quiet` suppresses the `[setup] USER=...` summary line.
- **`exec.sh --` flag/CMD separator** (closes #289). Mirrors `run.sh`'s existing `--` arm so the inner CMD can start with a dash (e.g. `./exec.sh -- my-tool --version`) without `exec.sh`'s own option parser capturing it. The separator is consumed by `exec.sh` before the remaining `"$@"` is handed to `docker compose exec`, so the literal `--` never leaks into the docker command line. Positional CMD (`./exec.sh ls /tmp`) keeps working — backward-compatible. 4-language `-h` usage updated with the new `[--]` synopsis token, an Options entry, and an example. New tests in `test/unit/exec_sh_spec.bats` (5 tests; total 1123 -> 1128; unit 1067 -> 1072): standalone `--` consumed before CMD passes through, dash-leading CMD passes through, `--` works after `-t TARGET`, no-`--` positional path stays backward-compatible, `--help` mentions the new separator.

## [v0.26.0] - 2026-05-13

Promoted from `v0.26.0-rc2` (#297). rc2 tag CI green (Self Test + release-test-tools). RC validation pass on `app/ros1_bridge` (the primary #272 validation target): rc2's `chore/template-v0.26.0-rc2` PR (`ros1_bridge#88`) built end-to-end (rc1 had been wedged at workflow validation; rc2 hotfix unblocked it). Cold baseline measured at ~18m26s total wall-time for the 4-shard matrix (jazzy-amd64 17m43s, humble-amd64 14m16s, jazzy-arm64 13m47s, humble-arm64 12m21s) — sits inside the #272 issue body's stated 15-25 min cold range. Warm-cache wall-time drop (#272 acceptance: >=30%) will be observed organically across the 13-downstream `/batch-template-upgrade v0.26.0` fanout PRs that follow this tag — each repo's first PR is a cold/warm pair on the same SHA when the fanout PR opens.

Bundles all rc1 + rc2 content (#281 / #286 / #287 / #288 / #292 / #293 + the rc2 hotfix); no further changes between rc2 and stable.

## [v0.26.0-rc2] - 2026-05-12

Second Release Candidate for v0.26.0. Hotfix on top of `v0.26.0-rc1` — the `cache_variant` input description in `build-worker.yaml` contained a literal `${{ matrix.target.name }}` expression token in the documentation block. GitHub's strict workflow validator parsed the description block as code, found `matrix` context at the workflow-input level (not allowed there), and rejected the whole workflow file at parse time — every downstream consumer that called `build-worker.yaml@v0.26.0-rc1` failed in 0s with "workflow file issue" before any job started. Base self-test passed because it doesn't invoke `build-worker.yaml`; the unit `build_worker_yaml_spec.bats` grep-based assertions passed because they don't run `actionlint`. This RC rewrites the offending description to use the bare expression token (`matrix.target.name` in backticks) plus a textual hint, dropping the `${{ ... }}` delimiters from the documentation string so the validator no longer treats it as an expression.

Bundles the rc1 RC plus `v0.26.0-rc1..main` between #294 (rc1) and rc2: #295 (`docs(convention): <repo>/script/docker/`) and #296 (`feat(build.sh): -t / --target alias`).

Follow-up issue queued: add an `actionlint` job to Self Test so this class of breakage gets caught in PR CI on `base` before it ships to a tag.

### Added
- **`build.sh -t` / `--target TARGET` alias for the positional `[TARGET]`** (closes #280). Matches `run.sh -t`'s UX so users learning one wrapper get the other for free; the positional form keeps working (backward-compatible). When both forms are passed the rightmost argument wins. The `*)` fallthrough that previously caught `-t` and silently treated `runtime` as `TARGET` (issue body: "works by accident") now hits the explicit `-t|--target` arm with proper value-required validation. 4-language `-h` usage updated. New tests in `test/unit/build_sh_spec.bats` (6 tests; total 1117 -> 1123; unit 1061 -> 1067): short form, long form, last-wins with positional before / after, value-required guard, usage help mention.

### Documentation
- **`<repo>/script/docker/` convention for Dockerfile-internal build helpers** (closes #275). 4-language READMEs gain a one-line convention note; `dockerfile/Dockerfile.example` ships a commented-out COPY pattern for build-time helpers separate from the runtime `<repo>/script/` (entrypoint and friends).

### Fixed
- **`build-worker.yaml` `cache_variant` description no longer triggers workflow validator rejection.** The literal `${{ matrix.target.name }}` token in the description-block string was parsed by GitHub as an expression and failed `matrix` context resolution at input declaration scope, causing every downstream `uses:` call of `build-worker.yaml@v0.26.0-rc1` to fail with "workflow file issue" in 0s. Description rewritten to use the bare expression token in backticks plus a textual hint, dropping the `${{ ... }}` delimiters.

## [v0.26.0-rc1] - 2026-05-12

First Release Candidate for v0.26.0. Bundles the #278 log-helper series (PR A `_log_*` foundations in `_lib.sh` + PR-1 top-level entry-point rewires + PR-2 `_msg` per-category split closing #283), the #272 GHA buildx cache plumbing (per-(repo, variant, arch) scope keys + `mode=max`), and #273 Phase 1 (doc-only PR fast-pass on `build-worker.yaml` via `dorny/paths-filter@v3`). Also bundles the post-v0.25.0 `.base/` path fixup (#287, closes #282) that downstream wrappers / Makefile / Dockerfile.example / workflows / 4-language READMEs all needed after the Phase 6 rename.

Primary validation focus on this RC: ros1_bridge wall-time drop from the GHA cache (#272 design target: >=30%% on a same-SHA force-push). Doc-only fast-pass (#273) validates on a single-distro consumer (e.g. agent/codex_cli) via a tester doc-only PR. Multi-distro env / app aggregator workflow extensions for #273 + #272 `cache_variant` wiring on env/ros{,2}_distro callers ship as separate downstream PRs after the stable v0.26.0 fanout, not bundled here.

No breaking changes from v0.25.0 for callers that don't tune behaviour; users on zh-TW / zh-CN / ja locales see `[run] ERROR:` style English level keyword in script output instead of the prior locale-translated keyword (the message body remains localised — see #283 design tradeoff). `_msg` is per-script and not exported, so the 1-arg -> 2-arg signature change is contained to the 4 user-facing wrapper scripts.

### Added
- **`build-worker.yaml` doc-only PR fast-pass via `dorny/paths-filter@v3`** (#273 Phase 1). New `path-filter` job classifies the PR diff against a 6-path allowlist (`**/*.md`, `doc/**`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/dependabot.yml`); when only allowlisted paths changed, `compute-matrix` + `build` jobs skip and the `docker-build` aggregator short-circuits to success so branch protection's required `call-docker-build / docker-build` check still resolves green without burning a 15-25 min matrix on doc-only PRs (README / CHANGELOG / translation fanout). Non-PR triggers (push to main / tag / workflow_dispatch) always set `code_changed=true` so release / post-merge runs are unaffected. Phase 2 (separate PR, blocked by Phase 1 soaking) rewrites the classifier as pure shell (`git diff --name-only base..head`) so the workflow stays portable to non-GitHub CI hosts without the action dependency. Follow-up: multi-distro env / app aggregator workflows (env/ros{,2}_distro, app/ros1_bridge `main.yaml`) extend the same pattern after Phase 1 validates on a single-distro consumer. New 7 tests in `test/unit/build_worker_yaml_spec.bats` (24 -> 31; total 1110 -> 1117; unit 1054 -> 1061).
- **GHA buildx cache plumbing in `build-worker.yaml` reusable workflow** (closes #272). All 4 `docker/build-push-action@v7` steps (`devel-test` / `devel` / `runtime-test` / `runtime`) now write to / read from a per-(repo, variant, arch) GHA cache scope so subsequent CI runs reuse intermediate layers instead of cold-rebuilding every shard. New `cache_variant` input (type: string, default: `""`) lets callers that invoke build-worker.yaml multiple times with the same `image_name` but different `build_args` (the env/ros{,2}_distro pattern) supply a per-call distinguisher; single-call callers leave it empty. Scope key shape: `${image_name}[-${cache_variant}]-${matrix.hardware}-cache`. `mode=max` exports all intermediate stage layers including the heavy `builder` / source-build stages; tradeoff is GHA's 10 GB cache quota, mitigated by GHA's LRU eviction keeping hot paths (ros1_bridge) cached. Primary validation target: ros1_bridge (the original pain point with ~15-25 min shards). Follow-up: env/ros{,2}_distro callers add `cache_variant: ${{ matrix.target.name }}` to differentiate their 4 matrix entries; `publish-worker.yaml` cache plumbing handled in a separate PR. New 5 tests in `test/unit/build_worker_yaml_spec.bats` (19 -> 24; total 1105 -> 1110; unit 1049 -> 1054).
- **`_log_err` / `_log_warn` / `_log_info` helpers in `script/docker/_lib.sh`** (#278 PR A). Tagged, level-prefixed output with optional ANSI color and consistent stream routing (ERROR/WARNING -> stderr; INFO -> stdout). Honor `NO_COLOR` (https://no-color.org/) and auto-disable color on non-TTY destinations; `FORCE_COLOR=1` overrides auto-detect. Color scheme: ERROR red bold (`\033[1;31m`), WARNING yellow (`\033[33m`), INFO dim (`\033[2m`). No callsites migrated in this PR — foundational; PR B (#278) migrates `build/run/exec/stop`, PR C migrates remaining top-level scripts. New `test/unit/log_spec.bats` (17 tests; total 1083 -> 1100; unit 1027 -> 1044).

### Added
- **`<repo>/script/docker/` convention for Dockerfile-internal build helpers** (closes #275). `dockerfile/Dockerfile.example` gains a commented stub showing the `COPY --chmod=0755 script/docker/<name>.sh /tmp/...` + `RUN /tmp/<name>.sh && rm` pattern, plus a matching commented `COPY script/docker/*.sh /lint/` in the `devel-test` lint stage so downstream repos with build helpers can opt into ShellCheck coverage without forcing the COPY on repos that don't have them. 4-language READMEs document the two-class split (`script/` runtime helpers vs `script/docker/` build helpers). Additive convention: existing repos with helpers only under `script/` keep working unchanged; new build helpers should land in `script/docker/` from the start. No test/code changes — pure documentation.

### Changed
- **`init.sh` / `upgrade.sh` / `script/ci/ci.sh` route inline `_log` / `_error` / `_die` helpers through the `_log_*` family from #278 PR A** (#278 PR-1). Each script now sources `script/docker/_lib.sh` and the in-file helper definitions become thin wrappers (`_log() { _log_info init "$*"; }` etc), so all three top-level entry points gain colored ERROR / INFO output on TTY destinations with `NO_COLOR` honored, without touching any call site. `upgrade.sh`'s `_verify_subtree_intact` integrity error block also migrates 3 raw `printf '[upgrade] ...' >&2` lines onto `_log_err` / `_log_info`. Test fixtures (`test/unit/init_spec.bats`, `test/unit/upgrade_spec.bats` HARNESS, `test/integration/upgrade_spec.bats`, `test/integration/gitignore_sync_spec.bats`) updated to symlink / copy `_lib.sh` + `i18n.sh` alongside the scripts they exercise.
- **`build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh` `_msg` i18n tables split per category and route through `_log_*`** (#278 PR-2 / closes #283). Each script's monolithic `_msg KEY` case statement splits into per-category sub-functions (`_msg_<category> KEY`) with a thin dispatcher `_msg <category> <key>`. Categories used: `bootstrap` / `drift` / `errors` (build, run); `errors` / `hints` (exec, run); `build` (run); `info` (stop). Each case branch strips its old `[<tag>] <translated level>:` prefix and returns plain i18n body only; level keyword + tag are added by `_log_err` / `_log_warn` / `_log_info` callers — **English-only level keyword** (non-English users now see `[run] ERROR: <body>` instead of `[run] 錯誤：<body>`; the body itself remains localised in zh-TW / zh-CN / ja / en, see #283 design). `run.sh`'s already-running guard and `exec.sh`'s not-running guard concatenate error + hint pairs into a single multi-line `_log_err` block for visual cohesion. Test assertions in `build_sh_spec.bats` that matched the translated level keyword now match the English level prefix + i18n body content. New `_msg KEY` API: 2-arg form `_msg <category> <key>` (was 1-arg `_msg <key>`).

### Fixed
- **Wrapper scripts (`build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh`) source `_lib.sh` from `.base/` instead of stale `template/`** (closes #282). Post-v0.25.0 fresh clones of every downstream repo failed at the `_lib.sh` source step (`cannot find _lib.sh`) because the wrappers hard-coded `${FILE_PATH}/template/script/docker/_lib.sh` while the subtree now lives at `${FILE_PATH}/.base/...` (#263 Phase 6 rename). CI stayed green because `Makefile.ci` paths reference `.base/` directly; only the user-facing wrapper invocation path was broken. Same `template/` -> `.base/` correction applied to: `script/docker/Makefile`'s `make upgrade` / `make upgrade-check` targets (they invoked `./template/upgrade.sh` which no longer exists), `init.sh`'s generated `main.yaml` `uses: ycpss91255-docker/...` workflow refs (`template` -> `base` post-GitHub rename) and its `TEMPLATE_REMOTE` default URL, the `TEMPLATE_REMOTE` default URL in `upgrade.sh`, `dockerfile/Dockerfile.example` COPY paths, `.github/workflows/{build-worker,release-worker,release-test-tools,self-test}.yaml`, the 4-language READMEs (badge / clone / setup / dependabot URLs), and 14 test files whose fixtures scaffolded the legacy `template/` layout. **No backward-compatibility shim** — wrappers, Dockerfile.example, workflows, READMEs, and tests assume the post-#263 `.base/` layout only; downstream repos that haven't picked up v0.25.0 yet must run the Phase 6 rename PR before the next upgrade. New regression test `test/unit/wrapper_lib_lookup_spec.bats` (5 tests; total 1100 -> 1105; unit 1044 -> 1049) asserts each wrapper sources `.base/script/docker/_lib.sh` end-to-end and that the "cannot find _lib.sh" error path still fires when the subtree is absent.

## [v0.25.0] - 2026-05-11

Promoted from `v0.25.0-rc1` (#274). RC tag CI green (Self Test + release-test-tools); no fixups needed between rc1 and stable.

Bundles #262 (`setup.conf` relocation to `config/docker/`) with the prep work for #263 (subtree-prefix auto-detect in `init.sh` / `upgrade.sh`). BREAKING: any committed per-repo `setup.conf` at the repo root must move to `<repo>/config/docker/setup.conf` during the next upgrade — the Phase 6 rename fanout PR bundles this migration into the same downstream PR that swaps the subtree prefix to `.base/`.

This release is intentionally NOT fanned out via `/batch-template-upgrade` — downstream picks it up later, as part of the Phase 6 rename PR that does `git rm -r template/` + `git subtree add --prefix=.base ycpss91255-docker/base.git v0.25.0 --squash` in a single per-repo PR (after the GitHub repo rename `template` -> `base` in Phase 4).

## [v0.25.0-rc1] - 2026-05-11

First Release Candidate for v0.25.0. Bundles #262 (`setup.conf` relocation to `config/docker/`) with the prep work for #263 (subtree-prefix auto-detect in `init.sh` / `upgrade.sh`). BREAKING: any committed per-repo `setup.conf` at the repo root must move to `<repo>/config/docker/setup.conf` during the next upgrade — the Phase 6 rename fanout PR bundles this migration into the same downstream PR that swaps the subtree prefix to `.base/`.

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **`setup.conf` relocated from repo root to `config/docker/setup.conf`** (closes #262). Both the template-side default and the per-repo override move:
  - `template/setup.conf` -> `template/config/docker/setup.conf`
  - `<repo>/setup.conf` -> `<repo>/config/docker/setup.conf`
  Aligns `setup.conf` with the other `config/` subgroups (`shell/`, future `apt/`, etc.). `setup.sh` / `setup_tui.sh` / `init.sh` / `upgrade.sh` / `build.sh` / `run.sh` / `_lib.sh` updated to read/write the new path. First-time bootstrap auto-creates `config/docker/` and seeds `setup.conf` there. `setup.conf.bak` and `setup.conf.local.bak` move alongside (`config/docker/setup.conf.bak`).
  **Downstream migration**: any committed `<repo>/setup.conf` override at repo root must move to `<repo>/config/docker/setup.conf` during the next upgrade. After the rename + `config/docker/` move the file resumes overriding the template defaults; left at the root it is silently ignored. The follow-up Phase 6 rename PR (`/batch-template-upgrade` style fanout for #263) bundles this migration into the same downstream PR that swaps the subtree prefix to `.base/`.
- **Subtree prefix is now auto-detected** (init.sh / upgrade.sh prep for #263). `TEMPLATE_REL` is derived via `basename "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")"`, so the same scripts work under both the conventional `template/` prefix and a `.base/` (or other) rename without any code change. All filesystem references, `--prefix=` flags, integrity markers, and symlink targets follow `${TEMPLATE_REL}`. Tests pin `TEMPLATE_REL="template"` in the upgrade.sh harness so unit assertions stay deterministic; new `init_spec.bats` cases assert the auto-detect works under both `template/` and `.base/` prefixes (3 tests, total 1080 -> 1083; unit 1024 -> 1027).
- **`upgrade.sh` commit message + warning paths parameterised**. The subtree-pull commit message changes from "chore: upgrade template subtree to vX.Y.Z" to "chore: upgrade ${TEMPLATE_REL} subtree to vX.Y.Z"; the post-pull drift warnings now report paths relative to whichever prefix the repo uses.

### Fixed
- **`Integration E2E` self-test job sanity check** updated to assert `config/docker/setup.conf` instead of the legacy root path (consequence of the setup.conf relocation; would have failed every CI run otherwise).

## [v0.24.0] - 2026-05-11

Promoted from accumulated PRs #266 (#231), #267 (#239), #268 (#249 section 1), #269 (#261). Final tag on the existing `template` repo before the `template -> base` rename (closes #263 prep step 1) and the `setup.conf -> config/docker/setup.conf` relocation (#262). Both #262 and #263 ship in `v0.25.0`.

### Added
- **Behavioural runtime-test smoke coverage** (closes #249's section 1). New `test/behavioural/runtime_test_smoke_spec.bats` drives `docker buildx build --target runtime-test` against a synthesized minimal fixture Dockerfile and asserts five build-level invariants: default smoke passes, `&&` chain override passes (regression guard for #243 word-split bug), bash parameter expansion override passes (regression guard for v0.21.1-v0.23.0 dash-source bug closed by v0.23.1), bash `[[` operator override passes (sister bash-only regression guard), and the gate FAILS the build when the smoke command exits non-zero. Excluded from the regular self-test count (1074) because docker buildx access requires the new `ci-behavioural` compose service mounting host `docker.sock`. Run via `make -f Makefile.ci test-behavioural` locally (opt-in; uses dedicated `template-behavioural` buildx builder so cache prune doesn't touch the user's other docker work), or via the new `Behavioural Test` job in `self-test.yaml` on CI. Infra changes: `Dockerfile.test-tools` adds `docker-cli` + `docker-cli-buildx` to the alpine image (selectively-COPY'd into downstream test stages only, no downstream image-size impact); `release-test-tools.yaml` smoke step extends to assert `docker --version` + `docker buildx version`; `compose.yaml` gains the `ci-behavioural` service definition; `script/ci/ci.sh` gains `--behavioural` flag with setup/teardown around a dedicated buildx builder.
- **`Dockerfile.example` concrete builder/runtime split reference + 3 lessons inline** (closes #239). Replaces the previous minimal commented-out runtime hint with a substantive opt-in pattern: `builder` (FROM devel-base, KEEPs source), `runtime-base` (FROM ${BASE_IMAGE}, ldd-driven minimal apt), `runtime` (COPY --from=builder install trees). Three lessons lifted verbatim from ycpss91255-docker/ros1_bridge#60 (saved ~1.1 GB/arch empirically): (1) `runtime MUST NOT be FROM devel` -- devel needs source for the rebuild loop, runtime would carry the bloat; (2) install only the libs `ldd` proves are missing -- bulk-installing builder deps defeats the split; (3) `source FILE` in entrypoints needs a trailing `--` -- ROS 1 catkin / `_setup_util.py` argparse pitfall when CMD has `--flag` args. Pattern is opt-in: downstream uncomments the blocks and switches `FROM devel-base AS devel` to `FROM builder AS devel`. agent/* repos (no runtime) leave it commented as before. 3 unit-test markers in `template_spec.bats` (138 -> 141) lock the stage-list entry, the three lesson markers, and the commented-out skeleton. Total self-tests 1071 -> 1074. Unit 1015 -> 1018.

### Changed
- **`config/pip/` relocated to `dockerfile/setup/pip/`** (closes #261, deferred from #254). `pip/setup.sh` is build-time install scaffolding -- it runs once during `RUN ${CONFIG_DIR}/pip/setup.sh` then gets wiped along with the rest of `${CONFIG_DIR}`. It never reaches the user's interactive shell, unlike everything else under `config/` (`shell/bashrc`, `shell/tmux/`, `shell/terminator/`, `shell/bashrc.d/`). Keeping it in `config/` muddled the layered-COPY mental model (#254): downstream `<repo>/config/pip/setup.sh` would visually look like a runtime override but actually only ever survives until the shell-setup RUN's `sudo rm -rf` -- a footgun for anyone trying to customise pip-install behaviour through the override layer. Moving it out keeps `config/` as a pure runtime-override surface and lets future build-time helpers (e.g. apt scaffolding) land under `dockerfile/setup/` alongside without re-introducing the conceptual mix. `Dockerfile.example` gains a new `ARG SETUP_DIR="/tmp/setup"` + `COPY --chmod=0755 template/dockerfile/setup ${SETUP_DIR}` + `RUN ${SETUP_DIR}/pip/setup.sh` + `sudo rm -rf ${CONFIG_DIR} ${SETUP_DIR}` cleanup (chained into the existing shell-setup RUN). 6 unit-test markers in `template_spec.bats` (141 -> 147) lock the new path, the absence of `config/pip/`, all four Dockerfile.example pattern lines (ARG / COPY / RUN with positive + negative regression guard / combined CONFIG_DIR+SETUP_DIR cleanup). Total self-tests 1074 -> 1080. Unit 1018 -> 1024. **Downstream migration**: existing downstream Dockerfiles continue to work unchanged on `make upgrade` -- their pre-#254 `<repo>/config/pip/` snapshot still serves the build-time RUN line. To start receiving template-side pip improvements, downstream needs the new ARG / COPY / RUN-path pattern in its own Dockerfile (mirror `Dockerfile.example`); track in a follow-up issue per repo as needed. **No fanout wave required by this release.**
- **`setup.conf` header rewritten + per-section inline docs trimmed** (#231). New top header explains the derived-file relationship (`.env` / `compose.yaml` are regenerated; never hand-edit them), the recommended edit flow (`./setup_tui.sh` interactive; manual edit supported), and the section-replace override semantics. The deep per-key documentation that previously sat inline (one paragraph per rule type, per GPU mode, per IPC value, etc.) is removed -- the TUI shows it interactively, README has the full reference, and the per-repo `<repo>/setup.conf` copy is now leaner (376 -> 121 lines, ~68% reduction). Existing per-section structure / keys / defaults are unchanged; this is doc-only. No user action needed on upgrade.

## [v0.23.1] - 2026-05-11

Patch release fixing `Dockerfile.example`'s runtime-test stage shell wrapper. No RC: bug-fix-class change per `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` policy.

### Fixed
- **`Dockerfile.example` runtime-test stage `RUN sh -c` blocks bash-source overrides** (template#249 follow-up, surfaced during ycpss91255-docker/docker_harness#57 rollout). `sh` on Debian/Ubuntu is `dash`, which has neither `source` nor bash parameter expansion. Any `RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD` override that did `source /opt/<framework>/setup.bash && <cmd>` failed with `sh: source: not found`; replacing `source` with POSIX `.` then failed with `Bad substitution` because `setup.bash` itself uses bash-only syntax. The only workable shape was a nested `bash -c '...'` wrapper inside the build-arg value, which is an ugly downstream UX.

  Fix: change `RUN sh -c "${RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD}"` to `RUN bash -c "${RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD}"`. Bash is present in every Ubuntu/Debian-based runtime image the template targets (osrf/ros, ros, plain ubuntu/debian), so the dependency is safe. Downstream `RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD` overrides can now use natural shell semantics including `source <bash-script>`, parameter expansion, and `${var:-default}` without nested wrapping.

  Three unit-test invariants in `test/unit/template_spec.bats` (137 -> 138):
  - Positive: runtime-test RUN line uses `bash -c` (regression guard for both #243 word-split bug and #57 dash-source bug).
  - Negative: no bare `RUN ${RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD}` (regression guard for #243).
  - Negative (NEW): no stale `sh -c` wrapper (regression guard for this fix).

  Total self-tests 1070 -> 1071 (+1 template_spec). Unit 1014 -> 1015.

## [v0.23.0] - 2026-05-08

Promoted from `v0.23.0-rc1` (#258). RC tag CI green (Self Test +
release-test-tools); no fixups needed between rc1 and stable.

Adds the layered `config/` override mechanism + `bashrc.d/` drop-in
directory (#254). Purely additive at the framework level: no
downstream Dockerfile changes required to consume the new tag —
`make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=v0.23.0` is enough.

## [v0.23.0-rc1] - 2026-05-08

First Release Candidate for v0.23.0. Adds the layered `config/`
override mechanism + `bashrc.d/` drop-in directory (#254). Purely
additive at the framework level: no downstream Dockerfile changes
required to consume the new tag — `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade
VERSION=v0.23.0-rc1` is enough.

### Added
- **Layered `config/` override at build time** (#254). Mirrors
  the `setup.conf` repo-override pattern, just at file granularity:
  `Dockerfile.example`'s `COPY ${CONFIG_SRC} ${CONFIG_DIR}` (the
  pre-existing `<repo>/config/` copy) is preceded by a new
  `COPY template/config ${CONFIG_DIR}` layer. The first COPY brings
  template/config/ defaults; the second overlays
  `<repo>/config/` on top -- file-level merge, downstream files
  override matching paths from template, files only in template
  fall through unchanged. Files only in `<repo>/config/` are
  added.

  Mental model:
  - `setup.conf`: repo skips a section -> falls through to
    template default; repo lists a section -> repo's section
    replaces template's section (whole section).
  - `config/` (new): repo skips a file -> falls through to
    template default; repo provides a file -> repo's file
    replaces template's file (whole file).

  Docker handles the merge natively via two sequential `COPY` of
  the same destination. No build-context magic, no setup.sh
  pre-merge -- just two `COPY` lines.

- **`bashrc.d/` drop-in directory** (#254, supersedes #253).
  `template/config/shell/` gains a `bashrc.d/` directory (empty
  placeholder via `.gitkeep`). `template/config/shell/bashrc` gains
  a bootstrap loop that sources `${HOME}/.bashrc.d/*.sh` at
  interactive shell start. `Dockerfile.example` gains a
  `mkdir -p ${HOME}/.bashrc.d` +
  `cp -n ${CONFIG_DIR}/shell/bashrc.d/*.sh ${HOME}/.bashrc.d/` step
  in the existing shell-setup RUN block. Empty bashrc.d/ is a
  clean no-op (the for loop has no iterations + `cp -n` with
  `2>/dev/null || true` for missing source).

  Use case: downstream `<repo>/config/shell/bashrc.d/<name>.sh`
  ships per-repo PATH additions, aliases, helpers without forking
  the template's `bashrc` file. Layered with #254's COPY chain so
  template-side helpers (in `template/config/shell/bashrc.d/`) and
  downstream-side helpers (in `<repo>/config/shell/bashrc.d/`)
  both end up in `${HOME}/.bashrc.d/` after build.

- 3 new tests in `test/unit/bashrc_spec.bats` (7 -> 10) covering
  the bashrc.d bootstrap loop and `.gitkeep` placeholder.
- 2 new tests in `test/integration/init_new_repo_spec.bats`
  (36 -> 38) asserting Dockerfile.example's two-layer COPY chain
  ordering and the bashrc.d setup step.

### Changed
- **`init.sh` new-repo seed behaviour** (#254, soft-breaking):
  pre-#254 `init.sh` seeded `<repo>/config/` as a FULL copy of
  `template/config/`. Post-#254 it creates an EMPTY placeholder
  with just a `.gitkeep`, leaving the layered COPY chain in
  Dockerfile.example to do the merge at build time. Existing
  repos with a pre-#254 full-copy `<repo>/config/` keep working
  unchanged -- their copy still overlays every template default
  at build time, identical to pre-#254 behaviour. They can
  manually trim files in `<repo>/config/` that match template
  default to start receiving template-side improvements
  automatically.
- `test/integration/init_new_repo_spec.bats` test
  "config/ is a real directory copied from template/config" ->
  "config/ is an empty placeholder" (new shape). The
  preserve-existing-config and stale-symlink tests still pass
  unchanged.
- Total self-tests 1065 -> 1070 (+3 bashrc_spec, +2
  init_new_repo_spec). Unit 1011 -> 1014; integration 54 -> 56.

## [v0.22.0] - 2026-05-08

Minor release adding `-C` / `--chdir` to the four wrappers for worktree-path
invocation parity with `git -C` / `make -C`. RC skipped: wrapper-only change,
no Dockerfile / release-pipeline impact, full unit coverage on the feature
PR (#255).

### Added
- **`-C <dir>` / `--chdir <dir>` flag on all four wrappers**
  (`build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh`) — operate on the repo
  at `<dir>` without changing the caller's cwd, mirroring `git -C` /
  `make -C`. Closes docker_harness#53. The pre-pass overrides
  `FILE_PATH` before `_lib.sh` is sourced, so `_lib.sh` lookup, `.env`
  load, `setup.sh` invocation, and `compose.yaml` resolution all
  honor the override. Critical for Claude Code's sandbox
  `excludedCommands` matching: top-level token stays
  `./build.sh ...` rather than `(cd <dir> && ...)` or
  `bash -c "cd <dir> && ..."`, neither of which the bash AST parser
  unwraps into the `./build.sh *` prefix. Must come before the
  positional `TARGET` / `CMD`. Long form `--chdir` is also accepted.
  Adds 20 unit tests across `build_sh_spec` / `run_sh_spec` /
  `exec_sh_spec` / `stop_sh_spec`.

### Changed
- License migrated from GPL-3.0 to Apache 2.0 (#246). Aligns with
  upstream `osrf/docker_images` and the rest of the
  `ycpss91255-docker` org; explicit patent grant and patent-retaliation
  clause; avoids the GPL viral concern when this repo is bundled as
  a subtree under `template/` in downstream repos. README License
  badge updated across all 4 language variants. The non-English
  badges' link path was also corrected from `./LICENSE` (a stale
  relative pointer to `doc/readme/LICENSE`) to `../../LICENSE`.

## [v0.21.1] - 2026-05-08

Patch release fixing a bug in v0.21.0's runtime-test stage example.

### Fixed
- **`Dockerfile.example` runtime-test stage RUN line was buggy in
  v0.21.0** (#243). Two issues:
  - `RUN ${RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD}` did Docker ARG substitution then
    word-split the value: shell operators (`&&`, `||`, `;`) and
    nested quotes were treated as literal arguments to the first
    word. Concrete failure: with default
    `bash -lc "whoami && bash --version && exit 0"`, `whoami`
    received `--version` as an arg and printed its own version
    info instead of running the chained commands. Fixed by
    wrapping the ARG with `sh -c "${RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD}"` so the
    value reaches sh as a single string for normal parsing.
  - `USER root` was the last `USER` in the Dockerfile (runtime-test
    is ephemeral but hadolint can't know that), triggering hadolint
    DL3002. Fixed by inheriting non-root USER from runtime;
    downstream overrides that need root should prefix the smoke
    command with `sudo`.
  - Default ARG also simplified from
    `bash -lc "whoami && bash --version && exit 0"` to
    `whoami && bash --version` -- the `bash -lc` wrapper added a
    login shell rc check but the nested quotes were the
    word-split trigger. The simpler form keeps the USER + bash
    + PATH coverage.

  Discovered during sick_humble's manual v0.21.0 rollout. Three
  new unit tests in `test/unit/template_spec.bats` (134 -> 137)
  lock the fix: positive assertion for the `sh -c` wrapper, plus
  regression guards for the bare `RUN ${ARG}` and `USER root`
  forms. Total self-tests 1042 -> 1045.

## [v0.21.0] - 2026-05-08

Promoted from `v0.21.0-rc2` (#245). Both RC tags' CI was green; no
fixups needed between rc2 and stable.

Roll-up of changes since v0.20.1:
- ROS-specific content removed from template (#240, via #241).
  Template positioned as generic Docker scaffolding; ROS helpers
  belong in downstream repos.
- `runtime-test` stage smoke framework + `devel-base` / `devel-test`
  stage rename (#243, via #244). Closes the runtime stage's
  behavioural validation gap with a Dockerfile-stage approach
  symmetric with the existing `FROM devel AS test` pattern.

BREAKING for downstream Dockerfiles: stage rename `base` ->
`devel-base` and `test` -> `devel-test` is required to keep CI green
after upgrading the `template/` subtree to v0.21.0+. Each downstream
upgrade PR must combine subtree pull with the local Dockerfile
rename atomically. See the v0.21.0-rc2 entry below for the full
migration notes.

## [v0.21.0-rc2] - 2026-05-08

Second Release Candidate for v0.21.0. Adds the runtime-test stage
smoke framework on top of v0.21.0-rc1's ROS removal. v0.21.0 stable
follows once both RCs validate cleanly.

### Added
- **`runtime-test` stage in `Dockerfile.example`** (#243). New
  ephemeral stage `FROM runtime AS runtime-test` mirrors the
  existing devel-test pattern. Body is `ARG RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD='bash
  -lc "whoami && bash --version && exit 0"'` + `USER root` + `RUN
  ${RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD}`. Closes the runtime stage's behavioural
  validation gap surfaced during the v0.21.0 stage-coverage audit.
  Default smoke is install-check style (USER set + bash on PATH +
  login shell rc files don't error); downstream override per repo
  via `build_args: RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD=<command>` to test domain
  binaries. Constraint: smoke command must be CLI-only — no GUI
  binaries that initialize Qt / OGRE on `--version` or `--help`.
- **`build-worker.yaml` runtime-test build step**. New step `Build
  runtime-test stage (install check)` after the devel build, gated
  on `inputs.build_runtime` so agent/* repos (no runtime) skip
  cleanly. Builds `target: runtime-test`; failure of the inline
  `RUN ${RUNTIME_SMOKE_CMD}` in the Dockerfile surfaces as a build
  error in the GHA log.
- 4 new tests in `test/unit/build_worker_yaml_spec.bats` locking
  the new step's shape (target name, build_runtime gate). 1 new
  test in `test/unit/setup_spec.bats` confirming
  `_parse_dockerfile_stages` correctly filters the new baseline
  names.

### Changed
- **BREAKING for downstream Dockerfiles**: stage rename for
  symmetry with the new runtime-test stage (#243):
  - `FROM sys AS base` -> `FROM sys AS devel-base`
  - `FROM devel AS test` -> `FROM devel AS devel-test`
  Downstream repos must rename these in their own root `Dockerfile`
  the same PR they upgrade their `template/` subtree to v0.21.0+,
  otherwise CI's new `target: devel-test` / `target: runtime-test`
  build steps will fail because the stages don't exist in their
  Dockerfile yet. The `runtime-base` stage keeps its name (it's
  load-bearing for the lean runtime image; pairs symmetrically
  with the renamed `devel-base`).
- **`build-worker.yaml`** CI target: `target: test` ->
  `target: devel-test` (mirrors the Dockerfile rename above).
  Workflow callers don't need to change anything in their
  `main.yaml`; the change is in the workflow itself. Downstream
  repos just need to keep their `main.yaml` `@tag` reference up
  to date and rename their own Dockerfile stages (see above).
- **`setup.sh` baseline blocklist** widened to recognise both the
  new and legacy stage names during the v0.21.x transition: `{sys,
  devel-base, devel, devel-test, runtime-test}` are the
  forward-looking baseline; `{base, test}` remain accepted so
  un-renamed downstream Dockerfiles don't accidentally emit `base`
  / `test` as compose services. Legacy aliases will be removed in
  a future major release once all downstream repos have renamed.
- **TUI per-stage messages** updated in 4 languages (en / zh-TW /
  zh-CN / ja) to surface the new baseline names.
- **Test count**: total 1037 -> 1042 (+1 setup_spec, +4
  build_worker_yaml_spec). Unit 983 -> 988; integration unchanged
  at 54.

## [v0.21.0-rc1] - 2026-05-08

Release Candidate for v0.21.0. Single change: ROS-specific content
removal from template (#240) to honour template's positioning as
generic Docker scaffolding. The runtime smoke framework (the
follow-up issue in the v0.21.0 plan) ships in v0.21.0-rc2 once
this RC validates clean against the 13 active downstream repos.

### Removed
- **ROS-specific shell helpers from `config/shell/bashrc`** (#240).
  Removed `swc` (catkin `devel/setup.bash` searcher), `ros1_source`,
  `ros2_source`, `ros1_complete`, `ros2_complete`, `_ros_detect`,
  `_ros_auto_source`, plus the `_ROS1_DISTROS` / `_ROS2_DISTROS`
  distro lists and the auto-source invocation at the bottom of the
  rc file. Template is positioned as generic Docker scaffolding;
  ROS-specific behaviour (auto-sourcing `/opt/ros/*/setup.bash` at
  shell startup, multi-distro warning) belongs in downstream repos
  (`env/ros_distro`, `env/ros2_distro`) that consume the template.
  Migration of the helpers to those repos is tracked separately at
  `ycpss91255-docker/docker_harness` and lands on the same release
  cycle so consumers don't lose the behaviour at next subtree pull.

### Changed
- **Test count**: `test/unit/bashrc_spec.bats` 18 -> 7 (removed 11
  ROS-related tests covering the helpers above). Total self-tests
  1048 -> 1037 (994 unit + 54 integration -> 983 + 54).
- **Neutralised ROS-flavoured examples in template-internal docs +
  comments + test fixtures** (#240): README + 3 translation copies
  (build-worker / release-worker example block, publish-worker
  matrix example, mermaid diagram repo label, ros_env.bats ->
  app_env.bats), `.github/workflows/publish-worker.yaml` example
  comments (ros_distro tag scheme -> generic 2-variant example),
  `setup.conf` annotations (network host / privileged / shm_size /
  env / tmpfs / devices sections), `script/docker/setup.sh` env_1
  inline doc comment, `test/unit/compose_gen_spec.bats` fixture
  variable names (5 #236 tests use `BUILD_TARGET` / `ROOT` / `BASE`
  instead of `ROS_DISTRO` / `/opt/ros`). The behaviours under test
  are unchanged; only the example variable names neutralised so
  template's perceived audience isn't locked to ROS users. Existing
  CHANGELOG historical entries (e.g. v0.20.1 describing the #236
  fix using ROS_DISTRO as the example) are left intact as
  historical record.

## [v0.20.1] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- **`setup.conf [environment] env_N` cross-reference now expands**
  (#236). When a later `env_N` value references an earlier sibling KEY
  via `${KEY}`, `setup.sh` now substitutes the earlier sibling's value
  before emitting to `compose.yaml`. Previously the literal `${KEY}`
  shipped to compose, and compose's own `${VAR}` substitution does NOT
  consult sibling environment entries -- the container saw the
  unexpanded form (e.g. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/foo//lib` after declaring
  `ROS_DISTRO=humble` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/foo/${ROS_DISTRO}/lib`).
  Order-sensitive: forward references and unknown names stay literal
  so compose's substitution layer (`.env` / shell env) gets a chance
  at file-load time. Transitive references resolve through the chain
  (env_3 sees the fully-expanded env_2). Implementation: new
  `_expand_env_cross_refs` helper called from `generate_compose_yaml`
  before the env block emits. 5 new unit tests in
  `test/unit/compose_gen_spec.bats` cover basic / forward / unknown /
  multi-ref / transitive cases.

## [v0.20.0] - 2026-05-08

Promoted from `v0.20.0-rc1` (#234) — RC tag CI was green; no fixups needed.

### Added
- **`publish-worker.yaml` reusable workflow** (#232). Opt-in
  workflow_call entry point that pushes a Dockerfile target stage
  (default `devel`) to a container registry (default `ghcr.io`) on
  tag push. Inputs mirror `build-worker.yaml` (`image_name`,
  `build_args`, `context_path`, `dockerfile_path`, `build_contexts`,
  `platforms`, `test_tools_version`) plus publish-specific knobs
  (`tag_suffix`, `is_latest`, `registry`, `target`). Default behavior
  for existing repos is unchanged: only repos that explicitly add a
  `call-publish` job in their `main.yaml` publish images. Designed
  for foundational image repos (`ros_distro`, `ros2_distro`) so app
  repos can `FROM ghcr.io/<org>/ros_distro:vX.Y.Z-<variant>` instead
  of duplicating sys / base / devel layers per repo. Auth uses
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GHCR; multi-arch via `platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64`
  publishes a single multi-arch manifest list under each tag.
  Documented under "CI Reusable Workflows" in template README with
  full input table and caller example.

## [v0.19.0] - 2026-05-07

Promoted from `v0.19.0-rc1` (#228) — RC tag CI was green; no fixups needed.

### Changed
- **`setup_tui.sh` main menu restructured into 5 grouped entries + `Features` discoverability surface** (#221). Top-level main now shows `image`, `build`, `runtime`, `mounts`, `advanced`, `features`, `Save & Exit` — replacing the previous flat list of 5 runtime/mount sections + `advanced` mixed at the same level. `runtime` (network / GPU / display / env vars) and `mounts` (volumes / devices / tmpfs) are sub-menu groupers; `image` and `build` get promoted from Advanced because they are commonly tweaked when wiring a new repo. Advanced is slimmed to truly-advanced knobs (security, named build contexts, conditional per-stage overrides, Reset). The new `features` entry is permanently visible and lists conditional / power-user features with a status row (today: `Per-stage overrides — enabled (N stages)` when a non-baseline `FROM ... AS <name>` exists, otherwise `— hidden (no non-baseline stages)`); clicking the disabled row pops a msgbox explaining how to enable, clicking the enabled row drills into the same editor as the conditional Advanced entry. No semantic change to any underlying section editor — every existing `_edit_section_*` is reachable via the new layout.

### Added
- 12 i18n keys × 4 languages for the new menu structure: `main.runtime` / `main.mounts` / `main.features`, `runtime.title` / `.menu` / `.back`, `mounts.title` / `.menu` / `.back`, `features.title` / `.menu` / `.back`, `features.per_stage_enabled` / `features.per_stage_hidden` / `features.per_stage_hidden_info`.

## [v0.18.2] - 2026-05-07

Patch release that ships **the correct `.version` metadata** for the work that landed under the v0.18.0 / v0.18.1 git tags. Both prior tags shipped without the standard `chore: release` step, so their tagged commits still carried `.version = v0.17.0`. Downstream consumers ended up with a stale `template/.version` after `make upgrade`, which made `make upgrade-check` perpetually report "upgrade available". Functionally those tags were correct (workflows, scripts, tests all matched their version), but the metadata file lied.

This release contains **no functional change vs v0.18.1**. Only `.version` and CHANGELOG bookkeeping. Downstream upgrade to v0.18.2 is a metadata-only refresh: same template content, same `main.yaml` `@v0.18.x` reusable workflow surface (modulo the `@tag` bump itself), and the local `template/.version` finally agrees with what the agent actually consumed.

Process gap that caused this is tracked in claude-workspace #36 (added `check_tag_version_consistency.sh` PreToolUse hook and a `Process discipline` section in CLAUDE.md so the same mistake cannot repeat — `git tag v*` is now blocked when the repo's `.version` file does not match the tag name).

### Fixed
- **`.version` file bumped to match the tag** (refs claude-workspace#36). Prior tags v0.18.0 and v0.18.1 carried `.version = v0.17.0`. Pinned consumers of those tags ended up with a stale local `template/.version`; `make upgrade-check` would loop "upgrade available" forever. v0.18.2 ships `.version = v0.18.2` so the loop terminates and `cat template/.version` agrees with the ref users pulled from.

### Added (v0.18.0 + v0.18.1 -- carried forward, no functional change in v0.18.2)
- See [v0.18.1](#v0181---2026-05-06) for the per-stage `[stage:<name>]` overrides feature, the standalone-emit fix, and the `--help` / `--lang` argument-order fix.

## [v0.18.1] - 2026-05-06

> Tagged with stale `.version = v0.17.0`. Functionally correct but metadata-only fix in v0.18.2 -- prefer v0.18.2 for new consumers.

### Fixed
- **`[stage:<name>]` per-stage list overrides now actually replace devel's lists at runtime** (#220 follow-up; v0.18.0 had this gap, fixed in v0.18.1). compose `extends` MERGES list fields (`volumes` / `environment` / `ports` / `cap_add` / `deploy.devices`) by appending child entries to parent's, not replacing them — so the v0.18.0 emit pattern of "minimal `extends: devel` + override list block in stage" left devel's X11 mount + DISPLAY env intact even when the stage set `gui.mode = off`. Confirmed via Isaac Sim headless validation: `docker compose --profile headless config` showed `/tmp/.X11-unix` and `DISPLAY` inherited despite the stage's `gui.mode = off`, and kit emitted the exact `X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication` warning the issue body called out. Fix: when a stage has any list-affecting override (`gui.mode` change, or any `volumes.mount_*` / `environment.env_*` / `network.port_*` / `*_inherit = false`), emit a **standalone** service block (no `extends: devel`). Top-level fields not yet in the per-stage allowlist (`cap_add` / `cap_drop` / `security_opt` / `devices` / `cgroup_rules` / `tmpfs`) are re-emitted from top-level so the stage still inherits those by default. Cost: a stage with even a single scalar override now produces ~150 lines of compose.yaml instead of ~10; compose.yaml is auto-generated, so the verbosity is fine. v0.18.0 stable tag is left as-is for record-keeping; users should upgrade to v0.18.1 to get the fix. Updated 3 integration tests + 1 new test (`stage-override: standalone emit re-emits cap_add / runtime / privileged inherited from devel`).
- **`build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh` `--help` now respects `--lang` regardless of argument order** (#222). Previously `<script> --help --lang zh-TW` printed English usage because `usage()` exited via `-h|--help` before the main parse loop reached `--lang`. The reverse order (`--lang` first) worked. Fix: a one-pass scan in each `main()` resolves `--lang` (and via the existing `_sanitize_lang` machinery, `SETUP_LANG`) before the canonical parse loop runs, so both orderings produce the localised usage. Flag surface unchanged. 9 new smoke-test rows in `test/smoke/script_help.bats` (zh-TW / zh-CN / ja across the four scripts).

### Added
- **Per-stage `setup.conf` overrides for runtime knobs** (#220). `[stage:<name>]` sections in `<repo>/setup.conf` override top-level settings on a per-stage basis when a corresponding `FROM ... AS <name>` stage exists in the Dockerfile (auto-emitted via #215). Driving use case: NVIDIA Isaac Sim's three-stage shape (`devel` for interactive dev with X11, `headless` for WebRTC livestream that needs `mode=bridge` + ports + GPU `video` capability + `gui=off`, `gui` for local-display that needs `gui=auto`) — previously all three stages shared one set of runtime knobs from top-level. Allowlist (v1):
  - `[deploy]` whole section: `gpu_mode`, `gpu_count`, `gpu_capabilities`, `runtime`
  - `[gui] mode`
  - `[network]` whole section: `mode`, `ipc`, `network_name`, `port_<N>` + `port_inherit` meta-key
  - `[security] privileged`
  - `[volumes] mount_<N>` + `mount_inherit` meta-key
  - `[environment] env_<N>` + `env_inherit` meta-key
  - Excluded by design: `[image_name]` (image tag is one per image, not per-stage), `apt_mirror_*` (build-time, not runtime), other `[security]` keys (no driving use case yet — re-evaluate v2).
- **Append-default + opt-out merge semantics for list fields**: stage's `mount_*` / `port_*` / `env_*` items append to top-level by default; setting `<list>_inherit = false` switches to replace mode (drop top-level entries entirely). Reverse toggle preserves the stage's own entries in `setup.conf` so flipping back to inherit doesn't lose typed values.
- **Stage section validator**: `[stage:sys|base|test]` is hard-error (baseline collision); `[stage:devel]` is reserved (v1 no-op, WARN; revisit in v2 — devel emits via env-var refs `${NETWORK_MODE}` / `${PRIVILEGED}` / `${IPC_MODE}` so override semantics are non-trivial); `[stage:foo]` referencing a stage absent from the Dockerfile is WARN + skipped; override keys outside the v1 allowlist are WARN + skipped per-key. 2 new 4-language i18n keys (`stage_unknown_referenced`, `stage_override_key_not_allowed`) supplementing #215's existing 3 keys.
- **TUI integration in `setup_tui.sh`**: new "Per-stage overrides" entry under the Advanced menu, **only shown when the Dockerfile has at least one non-baseline stage** — zero noise for the 17 existing downstream repos. Submenu structure: stage list (with override-count label) → per-stage section picker (gui / deploy / network / volumes / environment) → typed editors for scalars and the existing list editor for `mount_*` / `port_*` / `env_*` plus an inherit-toggle row. ~14 new TUI i18n keys × 4 languages. Menu placement / restructure (potentially promoting per-stage to main menu after user feedback) tracked separately in #221.
- **`_tui_conf.sh` writer extended to append NEW sections**: previously `_write_setup_conf` only handled overrides for sections present in the template. The first time a user adds `[stage:headless]` via TUI Save, the section is brand new; the writer now tracks template sections separately and appends new ones (with their keys, in user-input order) at end-of-file. Reader (`_load_setup_conf_full`) already handled stage sections via generic `<section>.<key>` namespacing — no change needed there.
- **Compose-emit integration**: `generate_compose_yaml` validates `[stage:*]` sections after Dockerfile-stage validation, then for each non-baseline stage with overrides, emits the resolved effective values as inline overrides on top of the existing `extends: devel` block. Stages with no overrides keep the byte-for-byte identical zero-diff path from v0.17.0 (#215). gui changes force `environment:` + `volumes:` re-emit (compose extends's child-replaces-list semantics drop X11 baseline cleanly). gpu mode flip-on with new caps re-emits the `deploy:` block; v1 limitation: turning gpu off when devel has it on isn't representable via compose extends and is documented as deferred to v2.

### Tests
- Total: **1011 tests** (957 unit + 54 integration). 42 new tests since v0.17.0:
  - `setup_spec.bats` +27: 20 helper unit tests (`_parse_stage_sections` / `_load_stage_overrides` / `_validate_stage_override_key` allowlist / `_resolve_stage_scalar` / `_resolve_stage_list` append-replace + ordering + meta-key skip) + 7 compose-emit integration tests (zero-diff regression, gui.mode=off strips X11, network.mode=bridge + ports, volumes.mount_inherit=false replaces, orphan WARN, disallowed-key WARN, `[stage:sys]` hard-error).
  - `tui_spec.bats` +5: stage round-trip via `_load_setup_conf_full` / `_write_setup_conf` (namespaced load, append new section, multi-section, full round-trip, in-place update).
  - `tui_flow.bats` +10: `_list_dockerfile_stages_available` / `_count_stage_overrides` / `_edit_stage_gui` / `_edit_stage_scalar` / `_edit_stage_list` (inherit toggle + add).

## [v0.17.0] - 2026-05-06

Minor release bundling two `setup.sh` / `run.sh` feature additions plus
two UX polish items. Notable behavior change: `setup.sh`'s hardcoded
`runtime` detection from v0.10.0 (#108) is removed in favor of a
generalized stage auto-emit path (#215). `runtime` still works (it's
not in the new baseline blocklist), but the implementation surface is
different, hence the minor bump.

The 17 existing downstream repos have no `FROM ... AS <name>` stages
beyond the baseline `{sys, base, devel, test}` (plus the optional
`runtime` for `app/ros1_bridge`), so this release is no-op for their
runtime behavior — `make upgrade` just refreshes the template subtree
and the workflow `@tag` refs. New repos seeded by `/new-repo` after
this tag pick up the auto-emit + `--build` UX automatically.

### Added
- **Auto-emit any non-baseline Dockerfile stage as a compose service** (#215, generalizes #108). `setup.sh` now parses every `FROM ... AS <stage>` line in the user's Dockerfile and, for any stage outside the baseline blocklist `{sys, base, devel, test}`, emits a corresponding compose service that `extends: devel` (inherits volumes / network / GPU / GUI / cap_add / additional_contexts) and overrides only `build.target` / `image` / `container_name` / `stdin_open` / `tty` / `profiles`. Use case: NVIDIA Isaac Sim's `headless` + `gui` entrypoint variants on top of `devel`. User flow: edit Dockerfile to add `FROM devel AS headless ENTRYPOINT [...]`, run any wrapper, then `./run.sh -t headless`. No `setup.conf` change required — Dockerfile is the single source of truth.
  - **Stage name validator** (`_validate_stage_name`): rejects baseline collision (`sys` / `base` / `devel` / `test` → hard error, exit 1) and reserved image-tag namespace (`latest`, `v[0-9]*` → hard error). Invalid format (uppercase, leading digit, etc.) is WARN + skip with the rest of the parse continuing. 3 new 4-language i18n keys (`stage_invalid_format` / `stage_baseline_collision` / `stage_reserved_tag`).
  - **Dockerfile drift hash** (`SETUP_DOCKERFILE_HASH` in `.env`): hashes just the stage-list projection (`^FROM ... AS <stage>` lines), so adding / removing a stage triggers `setup.sh check-drift` exit 1 (regenerate compose.yaml), but unrelated `RUN apt-get install` edits do not. Stored separately from `SETUP_CONF_HASH` so drift logs identify which source-of-truth changed.
  - **`runtime` stage no longer special-cased**: the v0.10.0 hardcoded `^FROM ... AS runtime$` detection (#108) is removed. `runtime` falls through the same auto-emit path as any other non-baseline stage (it's not in the blocklist), preserving its behavior with no regressions for repos that rely on it.
- **`run.sh` soft guard + `--build` opt-in for fresh-clone lint/smoke parity** (#216). On a fresh clone with no image cached locally, `./run.sh` previously fell through to Compose's auto-build, which only walks `target: devel` (or whatever `-t` says) and silently bypasses the `target: test` stage where ShellCheck / Hadolint / Bats smoke run. New contributors who reach for `./run.sh` first landed in a working dev container without ever hitting any of the lint/smoke gates that `./build.sh test` enforces — until CI failed downstream. Two changes:
  - **Default behavior — soft guard**: when the image is absent locally AND stderr is a terminal, print a 3-line `[run] INFO:` block before invoking `compose up` so the user knows the auto-build will skip lint/smoke and learns about `./build.sh test` / `./run.sh --build`. No behavior change. Suppressed when stderr is not a TTY (CI / cron / piped invocations stay clean). The image inspect is parameterized on `${TARGET}` so `./run.sh -t headless` checks `${IMAGE_NAME}:headless`, not `:devel` — important under #215 auto-emitted stages. New 4-language i18n keys (`auto_build_image_missing` / `auto_build_skips_lint` / `auto_build_full_hint`).
  - **Opt-in `--build` flag**: invokes `./build.sh test` (full lint + smoke chain) before `compose up`, ordered after `check-drift` so the build runs against freshly-regenerated `.env` / `compose.yaml`. For users who want one-command bootstrap with full local-CI parity. New `pre_build_invoking` i18n key.
  - **Option 4 (default fallback to `./build.sh test`) explicitly rejected** — would silently turn fresh-clone first-run from a few seconds into multiple minutes; that breaks user expectations more than the gap it fixes.
- **`build.sh` / `run.sh` config summary now prints a `Variables` block** mapping `setup.conf` `[volumes]` placeholders (`${USER_NAME}` / `${USER_UID}` / `${USER_GROUP}` / `${USER_GID}` / `${WS_PATH}`) to their detected runtime values. Pre-fix the Identity block showed resolved values under translated labels (`使用者 : alice` / `工作區 : /home/alice/work`), while the `setup.conf` dump printed the raw `${USER_NAME}` / `${WS_PATH}` placeholders, leaving the user to derive the substitution table. The new block sits between Identity and `setup.conf` in `_print_config_summary` and gives an explicit one-line-per-variable map. setup.conf stays the source of truth (placeholder form unchanged); the block adds 5 more lines to the printout. Coverage: 2 new unit tests in `lib_spec.bats` (populated case + unset-fallback case) and a new `variables` i18n key (en / zh-TW / zh-CN / ja).

### Documentation
- **`doc/test/TEST.md` cleanup**: removed 7 stale rows referencing tests that no longer exist (all referencing the obsolete `template/VERSION` / `.template_version` migration completed in v0.16) and renamed 5 rows whose underlying test was renamed (e.g. `_create_symlinks: produces all five docker-script symlinks` → `…all seven docker-script symlinks`, `_detect_template_version: reads VERSION file when present` → `…reads .version file when present`). Added a 27-test `## Smoke Tests` section documenting `test/smoke/script_help.bats` (16) and `test/smoke/display_env.bats` (11), which run at Dockerfile `test`-stage build time and are intentionally excluded from the headline self-test count. Headline now carries an explicit note clarifying scope. No code change.

### Tests
- Total: **969 tests** (915 unit + 54 integration). 34 new tests landed since v0.16.2 — 26 in `setup_spec.bats` (4 validator + 6 parser + 5 hash + 11 emit-loop integration for #215) and 8 in `run_sh_spec.bats` (#216 soft guard + `--build`).

## [v0.16.2] - 2026-05-04

Patch release. Single seed-template alignment fix for `Dockerfile.example`.
Existing 17 downstream repos are unaffected (`make upgrade` does not touch
downstream root Dockerfiles, and they already declare both ENVs); this only
matters for new repos seeded by `/new-repo` going forward.

### Changed
- **`Dockerfile.example` adds `ENV TZ` and `ENV LANGUAGE` to align with downstream fleet** (#210). All 17 hand-written downstream Dockerfiles already declare `ENV TZ="${TZ}"` and `ENV LANGUAGE="en_US:en"` alongside `ENV LC_ALL` / `ENV LANG`; the seed `Dockerfile.example` only had the latter pair. Pre-fix, new repos generated by `/new-repo` silently differed from the fleet on these two runtime env vars — the gap surfaces only for consumers that read the env directly (Python `tzlocal`, `gettext` translation fallback that uses `$LANGUAGE`, certain JVM tz resolution paths). The build-time `${TZ}` ARG handling and `/etc/timezone` write are unchanged. Coverage: 2 new structural tests in `template_spec.bats` lock the ENV declarations in the seed.

## [v0.16.1] - 2026-05-04

Patch release. Two CI plumbing fixes that surfaced from `seggpt`'s
v0.16.0 adoption — neither breaks the 17 existing downstreams (their
CI was already passing), but both unblock new repos using
`Dockerfile.example` verbatim or `setup.conf [additional_contexts]`.

### Added
- **`build-worker.yaml` accepts `build_contexts` input forwarding to `docker/build-push-action`'s `build-contexts:`** (#207). v0.16.0 (#199) added compose's `additional_contexts:` so that local `./build.sh` (which goes through `docker compose build`) could use named contexts in `Dockerfile` `COPY --from=<name>` lines. CI bypassed compose entirely — `build-worker.yaml` calls `docker/build-push-action@v7` directly — so the same `setup.conf [additional_contexts]` entry that worked locally failed in CI with `failed to resolve source metadata: no source for '<name>'`. Fix: new `build_contexts` workflow input (default `""`) plumbs caller-supplied `<name>=<location>` pairs into all 3 build steps' `build-contexts:` field. Caller usage: `with: build_contexts: \|\n  repo_root=.`. Path semantics differ from compose's `additional_contexts:` because `docker/build-push-action` resolves `build-contexts:` paths relative to the repo root (the `actions/checkout` working dir), NOT to `context:` — so a caller using `context_path: docker` writes `repo_root=.` here even though the same context in `setup.conf` is `repo_root=..`. Default empty preserves zero-diff for existing callers. Coverage: 3 new `build_worker_yaml_spec.bats` tests (input declaration, 3-step plumbing, zero-diff default).

### Fixed
- **`build-worker.yaml` user build-args now match `Dockerfile.example` sys-stage names** (#198). Pre-fix the workflow passed `USER=ci` / `GROUP=ci` / `UID=1000` / `GID=1000` (short form) to all 3 `docker/build-push-action` calls, while `Dockerfile.example`'s sys stage `useradd` reads `USER_NAME` / `USER_GROUP` / `USER_UID` / `USER_GID` (long form, also what the same workflow's "Generate .env" step writes). Result: `useradd` created `user` (the Dockerfile default), but the devel stage's `ARG USER="${USER_NAME}"` got overridden by the build-arg `USER=ci` so `USER "${USER}"` switched the image to UID-with-no-passwd-entry, exploding any subsequent `RUN` that resolved the username — `seggpt`'s CI hit `unable to find user ci: no matching entries in passwd file`. Fix: rename the 12 build-args lines (3 steps × 4 args) to long form so they hit the Dockerfile's sys-stage ARGs directly. No downstream Dockerfile change required (every existing `Dockerfile.example`-derived Dockerfile already declares the long-form ARGs). Coverage: 5 new `build_worker_yaml_spec.bats` tests lock the long-form invariant + assert no short-form regression.

## [v0.16.0] - 2026-04-30

Minor release bundling three setup.conf-area changes. Includes a
**BREAKING** restructure: `setup.conf.local` (introduced in #174) is
gone — the user override now lives at `<repo>/setup.conf` (committed,
not gitignored). Run `.claude/scripts/migrate-local-to-setupconf.sh`
on each repo before upgrading, or rename the file by hand.

### Changed
- **BREAKING: collapsed `setup.conf.local` + `setup.conf` snapshot back to a single `<repo>/setup.conf` user-override file** (#201). The post-#174 3-file model (`template/setup.conf` defaults + `<repo>/setup.conf` derived snapshot + `<repo>/setup.conf.local` user override) was redundant — the snapshot had no semantic effect on reads (`_load_setup_conf` only consulted `.local` + template), and a real bug fell out of the gap: bootstrap wrote `mount_1` to `<repo>/setup.conf` and immediately reloaded via a path that ignored that file, so a fresh `setup.sh apply` against an empty directory produced a `compose.yaml` with no workspace mount. The 2-file model is the pre-#174 layout with one critical addition kept from #174: bootstrap writes the **portable** form `${WS_PATH}:/home/${USER_NAME}/work` (not an absolute host path), so committing `<repo>/setup.conf` no longer leaks per-machine paths into git history. Surface area: `_load_setup_conf` now reads `<repo>/setup.conf` → falls back to `template/setup.conf`; `_compute_conf_hash` hashes the same pair; `setup.sh set / add / remove` write to `<repo>/setup.conf`; `setup.sh reset` backs up + clears `<repo>/setup.conf` only (no more `.local` to clear); the TUI saves to `<repo>/setup.conf`; `script/docker/lib/gitignore.sh` removes `setup.conf` from the canonical entries (it is now a tracked file) and adds `setup.conf.local` (so leftover `.local` files from earlier installs don't accidentally re-appear in commits); `init.sh` drops the now-obsolete `_migrate_setup_conf_to_local` helper; `upgrade.sh` adds `_warn_setup_conf_drift` mirroring `_warn_config_drift` so users see when upstream `template/setup.conf` adds new sections / keys and can opt into them by hand-merging into `<repo>/setup.conf`. Migration: `.claude/scripts/migrate-local-to-setupconf.sh` (one-shot, deletes after the v0.16.x cycle) renames each downstream repo's `setup.conf.local` to `setup.conf` and stages the diff; the same `init.sh` resync that would run on the next template upgrade then drops the old `setup.conf` line from `.gitignore` and adds `setup.conf.local`.

### Fixed
- **Bootstrap workspace mount no longer lost on fresh `setup.sh apply`** (#201). Pre-#201 a fresh `apply` against an empty directory wrote `mount_1 = ${WS_PATH}:/home/${USER_NAME}/work` to a file (`<repo>/setup.conf`) that the next reload step ignored, so `compose.yaml` ended up without the workspace mount. Post-#201 the same write target is the read source, so the mount lands in `compose.yaml` on first apply. Locked in by a new `setup_spec.bats` regression test that mkdir's an empty dir, runs `main apply`, and asserts the `${WS_PATH}:/home/${USER_NAME}/work` line appears in the generated compose.

### Added
- **`[additional_contexts]` section in `setup.conf` for compose's `build.additional_contexts`** (#199). Lets repos that keep source / `pyproject.toml` at the repo root (while docker assets live under a `docker/` subfolder) pull files into the build context without flipping the main `context:` root. Each `context_N = <name>=<source>` entry forwards to compose under every service that has its own `build:` (devel / runtime / test); empty list emits no `additional_contexts:` block, so the 17 existing downstream repos see zero diff. Inside the Dockerfile, reference the named context with `COPY --from=<name>` or `FROM <name> AS <stage>`. `<source>` accepts anything BuildKit takes — relative paths (`..`, `../third_party`), `docker-image://`, `https://`, `oci-layout://`. Use case: `ycpss91255-docker/seggpt` wants to `pip install -e .` at build time, baking the Python package into the image instead of relying on a runtime entrypoint install. Also adds: a `setup_tui.sh` flow under the Advanced menu for managing entries (mirrors the existing volumes / env list editor with the same add / edit / remove / cancel paths), `_validate_additional_context` validator (`<name>` matches BuildKit's named-context naming, `<source>` must be non-empty), 4-language i18n entries (en / zh-TW / zh-CN / ja). Coverage: 6 new unit tests for the parser + compose emission (`setup_spec.bats`), 5 for the validator (`tui_spec.bats`), 9 for the TUI flow (`tui_flow.bats`).

### Tests
- **Per-section setup.conf parameter end-to-end coverage** (#202). 25 new tests that set a single key in `<repo>/setup.conf`, run `main apply`, and assert the corresponding line appears in `compose.yaml` or `.env`. Companion negative tests confirm the block is omitted when the key is empty / cleared. Sections newly covered: `[deploy]` (gpu_mode/count/capabilities/runtime), `[gui]` (mode), `[network]` (mode/ipc/network_name/port_*), `[resources]` (shm_size), `[environment]` (env_*), `[tmpfs]` (tmpfs_*), `[devices]` (device_*/cgroup_rule_*), plus extras for `[volumes]` mount_2..N and `[security]` privileged. Existing coverage (untouched): `[image]` rule engine, `[build]` arg_N / target_arch / network, `[security]` cap_add / security_opt fallback, `[volumes]` mount_1 workspace, `[additional_contexts]` parse + emit. 923 tests total (869 unit + 54 integration).

## [v0.15.0] - 2026-04-30

Minor release. Single feature: nested Dockerfile support in the
`build-worker.yaml` reusable workflow (#195). Backwards compatible —
the 17 existing downstream repos see no CI change unless they opt
in by adding `with: context_path: <subdir>` to their main.yaml.

### Added
- **`build-worker.yaml` accepts `context_path` / `dockerfile_path` inputs** (#195). Lets downstream repos that nest their docker assets in a subdirectory (e.g. `docker/Dockerfile`, `docker/compose.yaml`) call the reusable workflow with `with: context_path: docker` instead of being forced to keep the Dockerfile at repo root. Both inputs default to current behaviour (`context_path: "."`, `dockerfile_path: ""` → falls back to `<context_path>/Dockerfile`), so the 17 existing downstream repos see no CI change. Use case discovered while migrating `ycpss91255-docker/seggpt`, where the docker environment lives under `seggpt/docker/` to keep template-managed files separate from `src/` and `test/`. Three new `test/unit/build_worker_yaml_spec.bats` tests lock the input forwarding so a future refactor can't silently revert one of the 3 build steps.

## [v0.14.0] - 2026-04-29

Minor release. Two test / quality follow-ups on top of v0.13.0, no
behavior changes for downstream consumers (the new WARN level on the
template-default fallback notice is the only user-visible surface
shift, and matches what the existing log-text already implied).

### Added
- **`test/unit/tui_flow.bats` lifts `setup_tui.sh` coverage from 18% to 83%** (#189). 44 new interactive-flow tests covering the 5 high-value areas the issue body called out: `_edit_image_rule` + `_compact_image_rules_after_remove` (#177 regression site), `_render_main_menu` / `_render_advanced_menu` (#178 Save & Exit unification), `_edit_list_section` mount/env/port CRUD, Save & Exit / Cancel / Esc abort handling, plus `_swap_image_rule` and several `_edit_section_*` dispatches. Same mock-driven pattern as `tui_backend_spec.bats` — file-backed queue stubs the dialog wrappers (queue line popped via `head -n 1` + `sed -i 1d` so state survives `$(...)` subshell calls), each test scripts the user's click path and asserts on `_TUI_OVR_*` / `_TUI_REMOVED` / `_TUI_CURRENT` outcomes. No real `dialog` / `whiptail` ever launches.

### Changed
- **`setup_tui.sh` 4-language i18n tables expanded to per-key assignments** (#189 prerequisite). The previous `declare -gA _TUI_MSG_<LANG>=([k]=v ... [k]=v)` literal blocks (~600 lines across en / zh-TW / zh-CN / ja) compiled into a single statement under kcov, so individual entries showed as 0 hits even when reached and capped achievable per-file coverage at ~45%. Each entry is now its own `_TUI_MSG_<LANG>[k]=v` assignment line, which kcov tracks separately. Runtime behavior is identical — `_tui_msg` still does the same associative-array lookup with English fallback. This is what makes the #189 >=70% target reachable; with the new tests the file lands at 83.29% (897 / 1077 lines).
- **CI `make` package added to the kcov coverage container's apt-install list**. The downstream-Makefile integration tests added in #175 / #182 (`make upgrade-check (downstream Makefile): exit 0 when ...`) shelled out to a `make` binary that the `kcov/kcov` image's apt repo doesn't ship by default, so they exited 127 only under `make coverage` even though they passed under `make test` (where the alpine test-tools image bundles `make` from #182). `script/ci/ci.sh`'s apt-install line now lists `make`, closing the env gap so coverage runs see the same recipes the regular CI does.
- **Template-default fallback notice promoted from INFO to WARN** (#186). `_announce_template_default_fallback` in `script/docker/setup.sh` now emits `[setup] WARN:` instead of `[setup] INFO:` when the per-repo `setup.conf.local` is missing or has no `[section]` headers. INFO scrolled past in normal `build.sh` / `run.sh` output and users missed the heads-up that template defaults were silently in effect; WARN matches the semantics (this is an unusual configuration state worth flagging, not a routine status line). The two i18n keys also rename `info_no_repo_conf` → `warn_no_repo_conf` and `info_empty_repo_conf` → `warn_empty_repo_conf` across all four languages so the message table stays self-describing.

## [v0.13.0] - 2026-04-29

Minor release introducing the `setup.conf.local` user-override file.
`setup.conf` is now a derived artifact (canonical-gitignored), regenerated
by `setup.sh apply` from `template/setup.conf` overlaid by
`setup.conf.local`. Existing repos auto-migrate on the next `make upgrade`
(`init.sh` copies any tracked `setup.conf` to `setup.conf.local` before
the gitignore sync's `git rm --cached`). No breaking changes from v0.12.4
for end-users — the migration is in-place and idempotent.

### Added
- **`setup.conf` is now a derived artifact; user overrides live in `setup.conf.local`** (#174). Pre-#174 `setup.conf` was tracked by every downstream repo and mixed two semantically different kinds of data: machine-specific workspace writeback (the absolute `[volumes] mount_1` path baked by `setup.sh` on first init) and user override (`[image] rules`, `[deploy] gpu`, etc. the user edits to deviate from the template baseline). Git history therefore permanently leaked each contributor's home directory — the v0.9.4 portable-form auto-migration was a workaround, not a fix. Post-#174 `setup.conf` is canonical-gitignored and regenerated by `setup.sh apply` from `template/setup.conf` ← `setup.conf.local` (section-replace strategy). User overrides move to a tracked `setup.conf.local`; absent files mean "use template defaults". Implementation surface: `lib/gitignore.sh` adds `setup.conf` to the canonical entries, `_load_setup_conf` reads `.local` (not `setup.conf`), `_compute_conf_hash` hashes `template + .local` for drift detection, `setup.sh set / add / remove` and the TUI write to `.local` (bootstrap empty when missing — no more whole-template copy on first edit), `setup.sh show / list` use a new `_setup_load_merged_full` helper to display the merged effective view, `setup.sh reset` clears both `.local` and `setup.conf`, and `init.sh`'s existing-repo path migrates a tracked `setup.conf` into `setup.conf.local` once before the gitignore sync's `git rm --cached` step — idempotent + skipped when `.local` already exists. Old-format detection logic (warn + auto-migrate stale absolute `mount_1` paths from another contributor's clone) is no longer needed and was removed because the underlying leak vector (committed `setup.conf`) is gone at the source.

### Documentation
- **README upgrade section now spells out `make upgrade` preserve-vs-regenerate semantics** (4 languages). Three existing sub-sections expanded inline (no new headings): `When setup.sh runs` adds a bullet for the upgrade path and notes that `setup.sh apply` preserves `WS_PATH` / `APT_MIRROR_*` from any existing `.env`; `Derived artifacts (gitignored)` calls out that `.env` / `compose.yaml` are regenerated on every upgrade; `Updating` replaces the dense one-liner with a numbered 4-step list and adds a prerequisites paragraph (git identity / clean merge state), an implicit-downgrade-refusal comment in the `make upgrade VERSION=` snippet, and a closing paragraph documenting that `<repo>/setup.conf` and `<repo>/config/` stay user-owned with a `diff -ruN template/config config` hint when upstream `template/config/` moved. Surfaced gaps that previously required reading `upgrade.sh` source: pre-flight guards (`_require_git_identity` / `_require_clean_merge_state`), `_warn_config_drift`, `Refusing implicit downgrade`, and the fact that `init.sh` (called by `upgrade.sh` step 3) also syncs `.gitignore` and runs `setup.sh apply`.

### Fixed
- **`_write_setup_conf` no longer wipes the file when dst and tpl alias the same path** (#187). `setup_tui.sh::_commit_and_setup` passes the per-repo conf as both arguments after the first save (`_template_src="${_repo_conf}"` when `<repo>/setup.conf` exists), so `: > "${_dst}"` truncated the file before the `while ... done < "${_tpl}"` loop opened it for reading — the read landed on an empty file, the loop body never ran, and the user's entire per-repo configuration was silently destroyed (saving from the TUI exited with the success banner but produced 0 bytes on disk; `setup.sh apply` then fell back to template defaults). Now slurp the template into a `__tpl_lines` array up front and iterate that, so the truncate-and-rewrite is safe regardless of whether dst and tpl are distinct files. Same regression guards through `--reset-conf` followed by a TUI Save (Save runs immediately after build.sh's bootstrap apply emits a fresh `<repo>/setup.conf`, hitting the same aliasing path). One new unit test exercises the dst==tpl path directly.
- **`Dockerfile.example`: drop dead `COPY compose.yaml /lint/compose.yaml`**. The /lint stage shellcheck'd `.sh` and hadolint'd `Dockerfile` but never read `/lint/compose.yaml` — the COPY was leftover scaffolding from earlier iterations. After v0.12.4 (#172) made `compose.yaml` a derived artifact (gitignored + `git rm --cached`), fresh CI checkouts no longer have the file and `docker/build-push-action`'s COPY step started failing on the build context for new repos generated from this template. The same dead-code line was patched out of the 10 affected v0.12.4 batch-upgrade PRs to unblock the rollout.

## [v0.12.4] - 2026-04-29

Patch release bundling two Makefile / setup-tui fixes plus the
template-managed `.gitignore` plumbing introduced in #172. No new
features, no breaking changes from v0.12.3.

### Fixed
- **`setup_tui` image rules are compacted on delete** (#177). Removing `rule_n` previously only marked the slot as removed, leaving `rule_(n+1) .. rule_max` with their original numbers; the next "add" then allocated `max + 1` instead of backfilling the gap, so the user was left looking at sparse indices like `rule_2, rule_3, rule_5`. The `__remove` branch in `_edit_image_rule` now calls a new `_compact_image_rules_after_remove` helper that shifts all higher-numbered rules down by one slot, so the menu always shows `rule_1 .. rule_M` consecutive and `add` allocates `M + 1` cleanly. The compaction loop walks occupied slots in ascending order and uses the existing override / removal primitives, so the in-memory mutation flows through to `_write_setup_conf` without any save-path changes.
- **`make upgrade-check` no longer surfaces a fake `Error 1`** (#175). `upgrade.sh --check` exits 1 when an update is available — a deliberate shell convention so `if ./upgrade.sh --check; then ...` reads naturally — but `script/docker/Makefile` and `Makefile.ci` invoked the script directly, so make treated the exit as a build failure and printed `make: *** [Makefile:28: upgrade-check] Error 1` after the otherwise-correct "Update available: vX → vY" line. Both Makefile recipes now wrap the call as `./upgrade.sh --check || [ $$? -eq 1 ]` so make sees success when the check itself succeeded; exit codes ≥2 (genuine network / missing-`template/` failures) still propagate. Two new unit tests guard the wrap pattern in each Makefile, two new integration tests run the recipe end-to-end through real `make` (the `test-tools` image now installs GNU `make` for this purpose, and `release-test-tools.yaml` smoke step adds `make --version`).

### Changed
- **`setup_tui` Save & Exit lives in the menu body on both backends** (#178). dialog used to render Save as a third footer button via `--extra-button --extra-label "Save"` while whiptail (no `--extra-button` equivalent — newt library limitation) injected a synthetic `__save` menu entry. The same repo therefore looked and behaved differently on a stock Ubuntu host (whiptail-only) versus a host with `dialog` installed, so screenshots and docs could not be shared. After this change both backends use the synthetic `__save` entry — placed last in the main menu — for identical UX, screenshots, and docs. Trade-off: dialog users lose the one-keystroke Save (must move cursor onto `__save` then press Enter); the unified UX is worth the extra step. Side cleanups: `_tui_menu` no longer reads `TUI_EXTRA_LABEL` (the env hook is now a no-op rather than removed, so unrelated callers keep working); `_render_advanced_menu` drops the `TUI_EXTRA_LABEL` save/restore dance; the OK/Cancel label translation in `_tui_run` (introduced in #136 for whiptail-spelling) stays untouched.

### Added
- **`.gitignore` is now template-managed** (#172). Two new helpers in `template/script/docker/lib/gitignore.sh` — `_sync_gitignore <path>` (append-missing strategy: idempotent, preserves user-defined lines, leaves a `# managed by template (do not remove)` marker on first sync) and `_untrack_canonical_in_repo <repo>` (`git rm --cached` for any canonical entry that's still git-tracked) — wire into both `init.sh` paths and propagate through `upgrade.sh`. Canonical set: `.env`, `.env.bak`, `compose.yaml`, `setup.conf.bak`, `coverage/`, `.Dockerfile.generated`. Future derived artifacts get appended to the lib in a later release and downstream repos pick them up automatically on the next `make upgrade`. The wiring also heals the v0.9.0+ drift where 15/17 downstream repos still git-tracked `compose.yaml` despite it being a derived artifact: the next batch-upgrade emits the `git rm --cached` in the same commit as the workflow `@tag` rewrite, with no separate sweep PR.

## [v0.12.3] - 2026-04-28

Patch release that completes the test-tools migration started in v0.12.2 (#165 + #164) and fixes a bash 5.3 silent-exit bug in `upgrade.sh --check` exposed by the alpine runner. No breaking changes from v0.12.2.

### Fixed
- **`upgrade.sh --check` no longer silently dies on alpine** (#168 follow-up). `_get_latest_version`'s pipe (`git ls-remote | grep -oP | head -1 | sed`) ends with `head -1` closing stdin, which SIGPIPE's the upstream `grep -oP`; with `pipefail` set, the pipe inherits that non-zero exit. Bash 5.3 (alpine 3.23 — the test-tools image runner) propagates the failed command-substitution exit through the caller's `set -e` and kills the script before any `_log` line runs; bash 5.2 (debian bookworm — the previous kcov/kcov runner) does not. Symptom was integration test #41 (`upgrade.sh --check reports update available from v0.9.5 → v0.9.7`) failing ~80% of runs on alpine with completely empty output but passing 100% on debian, with identical Dockerfile / upgrade.sh / bats version. Wrapped the pipe in `|| true` so the function unconditionally returns 0; the existing `[[ -z latest_ver ]]` → `_error "Could not fetch ..."` guard in `_check` still surfaces real network failures with a clear message.

### Changed
- **`compose.yaml` splits the `ci` runner into `ci` (fast) + `coverage` (kcov) services** (#168). The fast `ci` service now uses the prebuilt `ghcr.io/ycpss91255-docker/test-tools:latest` (alpine, with bats / shellcheck / hadolint / bats-{support,assert,mock} / parallel baked in), so `_install_deps` short-circuits via its `command -v bats` guard and no apt-install runs on each `make -f Makefile.ci test`. The `coverage` service stays on `kcov/kcov` and keeps the `APT_MIRROR_DEBIAN` plumbing introduced in v0.12.2 (kcov/kcov is debian-based and still apt-installs bats for the `--coverage` path). `_run_via_compose` takes a service-name first arg so `main()` routes default mode → `ci`, `--coverage` → `coverage`. Override the image with `TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE=...` for local rebuild flows.

### Added
- **`Dockerfile.test-tools` ships `parallel`** (#168). `bats --jobs N` delegates to GNU parallel; without it bats fails with `parallel: command not found`. `apk add parallel` makes the prebuilt image self-sufficient for the parallel fast-CI path. `release-test-tools.yaml` smoke step extended with `parallel --version` so a missing-parallel regression can't ship silently.
- **`_run_tests` graceful fallback to serial bats when parallel is missing** (#168). Older test-tools images (v0.12.2 and earlier) ship without parallel; the fallback lets downstream consumers running an older `test-tools:<tag>` still execute the test suite (slower) instead of hard-failing. New images carry parallel, so this fallback is dormant on `:latest`.

## [v0.12.2] - 2026-04-28

Patch release with two related test-tools fixes. No new features, no breaking changes from v0.12.1.

### Fixed
- **`Dockerfile.test-tools`: bats now runnable in the published image** (#165). The alpine-based final stage was missing `bash` (required by bats's `#!/usr/bin/env bash` entry point) and the `/usr/local/bin/bats` symlink (the upstream `bats/bats:latest` ships it but it lives outside `/opt/bats`, so the existing `COPY --from=bats-src /opt/bats /opt/bats` did not pick it up). `apk add bash` and `ln -s /opt/bats/bin/bats /usr/local/bin/bats` restore both. `release-test-tools.yaml` now runs `bats --version`, `shellcheck --version`, `hadolint --version` against the just-pushed image as a regression guard so a similar break can't ship silently again.
- **`compose.yaml` / `ci.sh::_install_deps`: `make -f Makefile.ci test` no longer hard-fails on networks where `deb.debian.org` is unreachable** (#164). The kcov/kcov-based `ci` service had no apt-mirror plumbing, so `apt-get update` always pointed at the upstream Debian archive even when the host's TW mirror responded normally. `compose.yaml` now propagates `APT_MIRROR_DEBIAN` (default `deb.debian.org`, no-op when unset) into the container, and `_install_deps` rewrites `/etc/apt/sources.list` (and `sources.list.d/*.list` / `*.sources`) with `sed` before running `apt-get update` whenever the env var differs from the default. Set `APT_MIRROR_DEBIAN=mirror.twds.com.tw` (or any reachable Debian mirror) on the host before invoking `make test` / `make coverage` to opt into the rewrite. The cleaner long-term fix — switching the `ci` service to the published `test-tools` image so the apt-install path is bypassed entirely — is tracked separately and depends on this image rebuild landing first.

## [v0.12.1] - 2026-04-28

Patch release containing a single bug fix to `upgrade.sh`'s version comparator. No new features, no breaking changes from v0.12.0.

### Fixed
- **`upgrade.sh --check` (and `make upgrade-check`) no longer reports a downgrade when the local pin is a prerelease ahead of the latest stable tag** (#156). Previously the comparator used plain string equality (`==`) — so a downstream pinned to `v0.12.0-rc1` while the org's latest stable was still `v0.11.0` would print `Update available: v0.12.0-rc1 → v0.11.0` and exit 1, telling the user to roll back. The new `_semver_cmp` helper applies SemVer §11 (pre-release < associated final), so `_check` now correctly classifies the three real-world cases: equal (exit 0, "Already up to date"), behind (exit 1, "Update available"), and ahead (exit 0, "Local is ahead of latest stable"). `_upgrade <older>` from a newer local version is also now refused with an explicit "Refusing implicit downgrade" error before any subtree pull, so a typo'd `make upgrade VERSION=v0.11.0` on a v0.12.0-rc1 working tree no longer silently rolls back the prerelease pin.

### Added
- **`_semver_cmp <a> <b>`** in `upgrade.sh` — pure-bash SemVer §11 comparator. Returns 0 / 1 / 2 for equal / a<b / a>b. Handles only the shape this project ships (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PRERELEASE]`) but applies §11 correctly: `sort -V` puts pre-releases AFTER finals (treats `-` as "less than empty"), which is wrong for our use case once a stable tag exists alongside its earlier `-rc` tags.

## [v0.12.0] - 2026-04-28

Stable promotion of [v0.12.0-rc2](https://github.com/ycpss91255-docker/template/releases/tag/v0.12.0-rc2). Two small developer-experience features and one consumer-facing bug fix; no breaking changes from v0.11.0.

### Added
- **`make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=vX.Y.Z`** pins the subtree pull to a specific tag (#152). The recipe forwards `$(VERSION)` to `./upgrade.sh`, so the no-arg form still resolves to the latest stable tag. `make` is the documented entry point for both flows; `./template/upgrade.sh` remains as a fallback when `make` is unavailable.
- **`setup.sh apply` / `setup.sh check-drift`** announce when the per-repo `setup.conf` provides no overrides (#150 / #153 / #157). On entry, if the per-repo `setup.conf` is missing or contains no `[section]` headers, both subcommands print `[setup] INFO: …` to stderr. Partial overrides (some sections present) stay silent — that is normal usage. Translated in 4 languages via `_setup_msg`. `_print_config_summary` (in `_lib.sh`) emits a parallel `(setup.conf has no section overrides — using template defaults; …)` hint inside the file-exists branch via the new `_lib_msg conf_empty` key.

### Fixed
- **`make upgrade` / `make upgrade-check` no longer fails with `No such file or directory`** in fresh consumer repos (#154). The downstream-facing `template/script/docker/Makefile` (symlinked into every repo's root) was calling `./template/script/upgrade.sh`, but `upgrade.sh` lives at template root: `./template/upgrade.sh`. The wrong path slipped in around v0.10.x and went undetected because no test asserted the target's recipe. Path corrected and a regression test added.

### Migration

Downstream repos upgrading from v0.11.0:

1. Bump `main.yaml`'s `@<version>` to `@v0.12.0`.
2. Bump `test_tools_version: v0.12.0`.
3. Run `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=v0.12.0` (handles subtree pull + `init.sh` resync + `main.yaml` `@tag` sed automatically).

For repos still on v0.10.x or earlier (no `template/.version` file, see #151), the first hop must use the fallback path because the older `Makefile.ci` doesn't forward `VERSION`:

```bash
./template/upgrade.sh v0.12.0
```

Subsequent upgrades from v0.12.0+ can use `make` directly.

### Known issues

- **#156**: `upgrade.sh --check` uses string equality, not semver-aware comparison. Repos sitting on a prerelease (e.g. `v0.12.0-rc2`) and running `make upgrade-check` get a misleading "Update available: <prerelease> → <older stable>" pointing at a downgrade. Workaround: `./template/upgrade.sh <target>` accepts an explicit version. Will be fixed in a future patch release.
- **#151**: 15 downstream repos (`agent/*`, `app/*` minus `ros1_bridge`, most of `env/*`) are still on the pre-v0.10.x template subtree and need a one-time `./template/upgrade.sh v0.12.0` bootstrap. Tracked separately.

## [v0.12.0-rc2] - 2026-04-28

Second RC for v0.12.0. Promotes rc1 forward with one fix that completes the empty-setup.conf INFO scope first introduced in rc1. No new features beyond rc1.

### Fixed
- **Empty setup.conf no longer silent on `build.sh` / `run.sh` rebuild path** (#157, #158). The INFO line added in v0.12.0-rc1 (#150 / #153) only fired on the `setup.sh apply` path. Rebuilds where `.env` / `setup.conf` / `compose.yaml` already exist took the `setup.sh check-drift` path instead, which had no INFO. Two-part fix: (1) extracted `_announce_template_default_fallback` helper in `setup.sh` and now call it from both `_setup_apply` and `_setup_check_drift` entries; (2) `_print_config_summary` (in `_lib.sh`) now emits `(setup.conf has no section overrides — using template defaults; …)` inside the file-exists branch, mirroring the existing `conf_missing` hint. New `_lib_msg conf_empty` translated in 4 languages.

### Migration

Same as rc1. Downstream repos validating v0.12.0:

```bash
./template/upgrade.sh v0.12.0-rc2   # one-shot, bypasses upgrade.sh's "latest stable" filter
```

(Direct `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=v0.12.0-rc2` will work AFTER you reach v0.12.0-rc1+; for the very first hop from v0.11.0 use the fallback above. Tracking in #156: `upgrade.sh --check` doesn't yet do semver-aware comparison.)

## [v0.12.0-rc1] - 2026-04-28

Release candidate for v0.12.0. Two small developer-experience features (`make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=...`, `setup.sh apply` template-default INFO) plus a bug fix to the downstream `make upgrade` recipe. No breaking changes; downstream repos can `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=v0.12.0-rc1` and verify before promoting to stable.

### Added
- **`make -f Makefile.ci upgrade` now accepts an optional `VERSION` variable** (#152). `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=vX.Y.Z` pins the subtree pull to a specific tag; `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade` (no `VERSION`) keeps resolving the latest tag. The recipe forwards `$(VERSION)` to `./upgrade.sh`, so empty expands to the no-arg form. This makes `make` the documented entry point for both latest and pinned upgrades; `./template/upgrade.sh` remains as a fallback when `make` is unavailable.
- **`setup.sh apply` now announces when it falls back to template defaults** (#150 / #153). On apply entry, if the per-repo `setup.conf` is missing, `setup.sh` prints `[setup] INFO: no per-repo setup.conf — using template defaults for all sections` to stderr; if the file exists but contains no `[section]` headers (comments / whitespace only), it prints `[setup] INFO: per-repo setup.conf has no section overrides — …`. Partial overrides (some sections present) stay silent — that is normal usage. Both messages are i18n'd in the four supported languages via `_setup_msg`. Previously the per-section fallback inside `_load_setup_conf` was silent for all 11 sections, leaving fresh-clone users with no signal that their entire run was template-default driven.

### Fixed
- **`make upgrade` / `make upgrade-check` no longer fails with `No such file or directory`** in fresh consumer repos (#154). The downstream-facing `template/script/docker/Makefile` (symlinked into every repo's root) was calling `./template/script/upgrade.sh`, but `upgrade.sh` lives at template root (`./template/upgrade.sh`). The wrong path slipped in around v0.10.x and went undetected because no test asserted the target's recipe. Path corrected and a regression test added.

### Migration

Downstream repos upgrading from v0.11.0:

1. Bump `main.yaml`'s `@<version>` to `@v0.12.0-rc1`.
2. Bump `test_tools_version: v0.12.0-rc1`.
3. Run `make -f Makefile.ci upgrade VERSION=v0.12.0-rc1` (handles subtree pull + `init.sh` resync + `main.yaml` `@tag` sed automatically).

## [v0.11.0] - 2026-04-27

Stable promotion of [v0.11.0-rc1](https://github.com/ycpss91255-docker/template/releases/tag/v0.11.0-rc1). Closes Phase B of #49 — `setup.sh` is now a git-style CLI backend (`apply` / `check-drift` / `set` / `show` / `list` / `add` / `remove` / `reset`). **BREAKING** for any caller invoking `setup.sh` without a subcommand.

Post-rc1 additions: a batch of GitHub Actions Node 24 upgrades (every action we use is now on Node 24) plus README / TEST.md alignment fixes found in a full audit sweep.

### Added
- All rc1 work (subcommand dispatcher #138, set/show/list #142, add/remove #143, reset #144). See [v0.11.0-rc1] block below for full details.

### Changed
- **GitHub Actions runtime bumped to Node 24** across every reusable workflow downstream repos call (#111–#115 dependabot batch + #147 manual qemu/login bump):
  - `actions/checkout` v4 → v6 (#111)
  - `codecov/codecov-action` v5 → v6 (#112)
  - `softprops/action-gh-release` v2 → v3 (#113)
  - `docker/setup-buildx-action` v3 → v4 (#114) — also drops deprecated `install` input (we never used it)
  - `docker/build-push-action` v6 → v7 (#115) — also drops `DOCKER_BUILD_NO_SUMMARY` / `DOCKER_BUILD_EXPORT_RETENTION_DAYS` envs (we never set them)
  - `docker/setup-qemu-action` v3 → v4 (#147) — manual bump (dependabot's batch hit `open-pull-requests-limit: 5`; picked up so v0.11.0's Node 24 coverage is complete)
  - `docker/login-action` v3 → v4 (#147) — same reason

  Requires Actions Runner ≥ v2.327.1, which GitHub-hosted runners have shipped since 2025-09. Self-hosted fleets must update before pinning to `@v0.11.0`.

### Fixed
- **Doc alignment caught in audit sweep** (#146 / #148):
  - `[Unreleased]` had not been updated by the dependabot batch (CLAUDE.md `變更完成 checklist` now explicitly covers bot PRs)
  - 4-language README missing `setup.sh subcommands` section + BREAKING migration table
  - `build-worker.yaml inputs` table missing `platforms` + `test_tools_version` inputs (added in v0.10.0 / v0.10.1)
  - English README missing the `### Interactive TUI` section that 3 translations carried (4-lang structural parity restored)
  - `TEST.md` per-spec counts for `bashrc_spec.bats` (14 → 18) and `upgrade_spec.bats` (20 → 18) had drifted

### Migration

Downstream repos upgrading from v0.10.x:

1. Bump `main.yaml`'s `@<version>` to `@v0.11.0`.
2. Bump `test_tools_version: v0.11.0`.
3. If any custom script invokes `setup.sh` directly without a subcommand, prepend `apply`. Bundled `build.sh` / `run.sh` / `init.sh` / `setup_tui.sh` are already updated.
4. Run `./template/upgrade.sh v0.11.0` (handles subtree pull + `init.sh` resync + `main.yaml` `@tag` sed automatically).

## [v0.11.0-rc1] - 2026-04-27

Release candidate for v0.11.0. Closes Phase B of #49 — the `setup.sh` CLI is now a git-style backend with `apply` / `check-drift` / `set` / `show` / `list` / `add` / `remove` / `reset` subcommands. **BREAKING** for any caller invoking `setup.sh` without a subcommand.

Validate downstream before promoting to stable: pull `ghcr.io/ycpss91255-docker/test-tools:v0.11.0-rc1`, bump one repo's `main.yaml` to `@v0.11.0-rc1` + `test_tools_version: v0.11.0-rc1`, and confirm `./build.sh test` passes.

### Added
- **`setup.sh` git-style subcommand dispatcher** (#49 Phase B-1). New explicit subcommands: `apply` (regenerate `.env` + `compose.yaml`) and `check-drift` (compare current state against `.env`'s `SETUP_*` metadata, exit 0 when in sync / 1 when drift detected). `build.sh` / `run.sh` switched their drift-check from `source setup.sh` + `_check_setup_drift` to `bash setup.sh check-drift` (subprocess), structurally closing the `_msg` shadow bug class behind #101.
- **`setup.sh set` / `show` / `list` subcommands** (#49 Phase B-2). `set <section>.<key> <value>` writes to `setup.conf` via the same `_upsert_conf_value` helper the TUI uses (creates section / key on demand). Typed keys validate against `_tui_conf.sh` validators — `deploy.gpu_count`, `volumes.mount_*`, `devices.cgroup_rule_*`, `network.port_*`, `environment.env_*`, `resources.shm_size`; unknown sections / invalid values exit 2 with i18n'd stderr. `show <section>.<key>` prints a single value, `show <section>` dumps all keys in on-disk order; missing key / section exits 1. `list` (no arg) prints the full setup.conf as INI sections; `list <section>` aliases `show <section>`.
- **`setup.sh add` / `remove` subcommands** (#49 Phase B-3). `add <section>.<list> <value>` appends to a list-style section by picking the next available numeric slot — first reuses any slot whose value is empty (matches the TUI's `_edit_list_section` placeholder-fill behaviour), otherwise uses `max+1`. Validators fire through the same `_setup_validate_kv` table B-2 set up. `remove <section>.<key>` deletes an exact key; `remove <section>.<list> <value>` finds the first `<list>_*` whose value matches and deletes that key (one entry per call). Comments and the rest of the file preserved verbatim via `_write_setup_conf`.
- **`setup.sh reset` subcommand** (#49 Phase B-4). Overwrites `setup.conf` with the template default, archiving the prior `setup.conf` to `setup.conf.bak` and the prior `.env` to `.env.bak` for one-shot rollback. Mirrors what `build.sh --reset-conf` does today but accessible directly via `setup.sh` for scripted use. Without `--yes`, prompts for confirmation; non-tty without `--yes` refuses to proceed (safety guard against pipeline mishaps). None of the read/write subcommands (set / add / remove / reset) regenerate `.env` — chain `setup.sh apply` explicitly when needed.

### Changed
- **BREAKING — `setup.sh` no-arg / flag-only invocation no longer aliases to `apply`** (#49 Phase B-4). Pre-v0.11, both `setup.sh` (no args) and `setup.sh --base-path X --lang Y` (no subcommand) silently fell through to `apply`, regenerating `.env` + `compose.yaml`. Now no-arg prints help and exits 0; flag-only invocation errors with `Unknown subcommand`. Migration: every direct setup.sh call must explicitly pass a subcommand. `build.sh`, `run.sh`, `setup_tui.sh`, and `init.sh` all updated in this release to pass `apply` explicitly. Downstream repos calling `setup.sh` from custom scripts need to add `apply`.
- **`init.sh` now scaffolds `main.yaml` with `permissions: contents: write`** (closes #62). New downstream repos generated by `./template/init.sh` get the permission block by default, so their first release tag push doesn't 403 at `softprops/action-gh-release` (ros1_bridge v1.5.0 hit this — caller-level permission grant is required because reusable workflow permissions intersect with the caller's, and GitHub's default GITHUB_TOKEN is read-only). Existing downstream repos must add the block manually one-time.

### Fixed
- **`setup_tui.sh` aborts on whiptail-only hosts** (closes #136). `_tui_run` hardcoded dialog's flag spellings (`--ok-label` / `--cancel-label`) which whiptail rejects with `unknown option`, breaking the very first menu on Ubuntu 22.04 minimal / Jetson arm64 (no `dialog` package). `_tui_backend.sh` now translates the spelling per `${TUI_BACKEND}`: dialog keeps `--ok-label` / `--cancel-label` / `--extra-button` / `--extra-label`; whiptail gets `--ok-button` / `--cancel-button` and skips the extra-button block entirely (whiptail has no third button). To preserve the Save & Exit affordance on whiptail, `_render_main_menu` injects a synthetic `__save` menu entry (i18n'd in all 4 languages).
- **`_msg` shadow bug after sourcing `setup.sh`** (closes #101). `build.sh` / `run.sh` used to source `setup.sh` to obtain `_check_setup_drift`; `setup.sh`'s top-level `_msg()` (with only 3 keys) silently shadowed the caller's richer `_msg()` (with `drift_regen` / `err_no_env` / `err_rerun_setup`). `_msg drift_regen` then returned empty and `printf "%s\n" ""` ate the drift-regen status line on every fresh-host / setup.conf-changed run (Jetson headless first surfaced it). Defensive fix: rename `setup.sh`'s `_msg()` → `_setup_msg()`. The B-1 subprocess switch above retires the entire `source` pattern as a structural follow-on.

### Migration

Downstream repos upgrading from `v0.10.x` should:

1. Bump `main.yaml`'s `@<version>` to `@v0.11.0-rc1` (or `@v0.11.0` once stable).
2. Bump `test_tools_version: v0.11.0-rc1` (or `v0.11.0`).
3. If any custom script invokes `setup.sh` directly without a subcommand, add `apply`.
4. Run `./template/upgrade.sh v0.11.0-rc1` (handles the subtree pull + `init.sh` resync + main.yaml `@tag` sed automatically).

## [v0.10.2] - 2026-04-24

Companion hotfix to v0.10.1. Same downstream-release blocker (call-release couldn't produce a GitHub Release), different root cause — this one fires *after* build passes. **Strongly recommended** with v0.10.1 for any repo cutting a release.

### Fixed
- **`release-worker.yaml` no longer tries to copy `compose.yaml` into the release archive.** The file has been a setup.sh-generated derived artifact (gitignored) since v0.9.0 — keeping it in the `cp -r` list meant `call-release` hit `cp: cannot stat 'compose.yaml': No such file or directory` on every tag push. `action-gh-release` never ran so no GitHub Release was created. Surfaced by ros1_bridge's v1.5.0 release attempt (same session as the test_tools_version fix). Removed `compose.yaml` from the cp list; regression tests added (negative + positive cp-list assertions).

## [v0.10.1] - 2026-04-24

Critical hotfix for v0.10.0. Downstream repos cutting their own release tag (`v*`) hit a hard 404 in the `test` stage via `build-worker.yaml`'s wrong-ref parse, blocking `call-release`. **Strongly recommended** for any downstream repo planning to cut a release.

### Changed
- **BREAKING for callers pinned to `@v0.10.0`**: `build-worker.yaml` gains a new input `test_tools_version` (default `"latest"`). Downstream `main.yaml` should pin it to the template release they upgraded from (e.g. `test_tools_version: v0.10.1`) for reproducibility. Repos on `@v0.10.0` or below that never cut a release tag keep working on unpinned `:latest` (unchanged from v0.10.0's silent GHCR fallback during branch / PR pushes).

### Fixed
- **`build-worker.yaml` auto-parse bug on tagged downstream releases.** v0.10.0's `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF` parsing read the **caller's** ref — when a downstream repo pushed its own release tag (e.g. `v1.5.0`), the workflow tried to pull `ghcr.io/.../test-tools:v1.5.0` (doesn't exist) instead of template's pinned `:v0.10.0`. Surfaced first by ros1_bridge's v1.5.0 release attempt. Fix: drop the `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF` parse entirely, require caller to pass `test_tools_version` explicitly (defaults to `latest`). Regression test added to `template_spec.bats`.

## [v0.10.0] - 2026-04-24

First stable minor bump post-v0.9.x. Cuts the rc2 feature work + two fixes. **Recommended upgrade path** for all downstream repos (rc1 / rc2 supersede everything earlier, see rc1/rc2 notes below for the full run-phase UX realignment + arm64 test-tools hotfix).

### Added
- **`--reset-conf` flag** on `build.sh` (closes #124). Overwrites `setup.conf` with the template default, backing up the previous `setup.conf` → `setup.conf.bak` and `.env` → `.env.bak` first. Interactive confirmation prompt; `-y` / `--yes` skips it. Internally delegates to the new `./template/init.sh --gen-conf --force` backend. Triggers a `setup.sh` rerun afterward so `.env` + `compose.yaml` regenerate from the fresh conf.
- `./template/init.sh --gen-conf --force` — backend for the above. Without `--force`, `--gen-conf` still refuses to clobber an existing `setup.conf` (unchanged default).
- New-repo `.gitignore` template gains `setup.conf.bak` and `.env.bak` entries so the reset backups never get committed by accident.

### Fixed
- **`upgrade.sh` main.yaml sed regex now handles semver pre-release tags** (closes #61). The prior `[0-9.]*` character class stopped at the first `-`, so upgrading from an existing RC tag (e.g. `v0.10.0-rc1` → `-rc2`) left the old `-rcN` suffix in place and produced `@v0.10.0-rc2-rc1`. First surfaced when ros1_bridge ran `./template/upgrade.sh v0.10.0-rc2` from `@v0.9.13`. Regex now anchored on full semver shape (`\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-[0-9A-Za-z.-]+)?`). Two regression tests added covering RC → RC and RC → stable transitions.

### Release summary

Cumulative highlights from rc1 + rc2 rolled up here for discoverability:

- **Run-phase UX realignment (BREAKING, from rc1, closes #118)**: `./run.sh` target now moves behind explicit `-t/--target`; positional args become CMD passthrough matching `docker run <image> [cmd]`. Migration: `./run.sh runtime` → `./run.sh -t runtime`; plain `./run.sh` unchanged.
- **Compose `runtime` service auto-emission (from rc1, closes #108)**: `setup.sh` detects `FROM … AS runtime` in the Dockerfile and emits a paired service extending `devel`, so `./run.sh -t runtime` actually works.
- **arm64 `test-tools` binaries are now genuinely aarch64 (from rc2)**: `Dockerfile.test-tools` `ARG TARGETARCH=amd64` default used to shadow BuildKit's auto-inject (moby/buildkit#3403), shipping x86_64 shellcheck / hadolint inside the arm64 image. v0.10.0-rc2+ drops the default; multi-arch GHCR `:v0.10.0` variants carry the right binaries per arch.

Downstream repos upgrading from v0.9.x straight to v0.10.0 should:

1. `./template/upgrade.sh v0.10.0`
2. Dockerfile: adopt `ARG TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE="test-tools:local"` + `FROM ${TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE} AS test-tools-stage` + `COPY --from=test-tools-stage` (see `template/dockerfile/Dockerfile.example`).
3. Audit any `./run.sh <target>` call sites and rewrite as `./run.sh -t <target>`.

## [v0.10.0-rc2] - 2026-04-24

Second release candidate. Ships the arm64 test-tools hotfix that v0.10.0-rc1 / v0.9.13 both missed — **strongly recommended** over rc1 for any downstream repo enabling the arm64 build matrix.

### Fixed
- **`Dockerfile.test-tools` `ARG TARGETARCH=amd64` default shadowed BuildKit's per-platform auto-inject** ([moby/buildkit#3403](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/3403)). Every multi-arch build published via `release-test-tools.yaml` (v0.9.13, v0.10.0-rc1) therefore fell back to `amd64` and shipped x86_64 `shellcheck` / `hadolint` binaries inside the arm64 image variant. Symptom downstream: `shellcheck: Exec format error` on arm64 CI (ros1_bridge PR #27 first surfaced it). Fix: declare `ARG TARGETARCH` without default so BuildKit's injected value drives the `case` branch. Regression test added: `Dockerfile.test-tools ARG TARGETARCH has no default value`. Requires a new tag + `release-test-tools.yaml` re-run to reissue `:v0.10.0-rc2` + `:latest` on GHCR.

## [v0.10.0-rc1] - 2026-04-24

Release candidate for v0.10.0. BREAKING: `run.sh` arg semantics realigned.
Validate on `ros1_bridge` (`./run.sh -t runtime` attaches to bridge logs,
`./run.sh -t runtime bash` drops into runtime shell) + at least one
GUI-using env repo before promoting to v0.10.0.

### Added
- **`runtime` compose service auto-emission (closes #108)**. `setup.sh` now detects a `FROM <base> AS runtime` stage in the sibling Dockerfile and emits a paired `runtime` service that `extends: { service: devel }` (inherits volumes / env / network / GPU / caps), overrides `build.target`, `image` (`:runtime` tag), `container_name` (`<name>-runtime`), and flips `stdin_open: false` / `tty: false` for headless auto-run. Gated by `profiles: [runtime]` so plain `compose up` still scopes to `devel`; `compose run runtime` / `compose up runtime` (and `./run.sh -t runtime`) target it explicitly. Repos without an `AS runtime` stage get no emission (no broken service entry).

### Changed
- **BREAKING: `./run.sh` arg semantics aligned with `docker run <image> [cmd]` (closes #118).**
  - Target is now the explicit `-t TARGET` / `--target TARGET` flag (default `devel`).
  - Positional args after options are the CMD to run inside the container, mirroring `exec.sh`. Empty CMD → Dockerfile CMD runs (`devel` = `bash`, `runtime` = its auto-run service). Non-empty CMD → overrides Dockerfile CMD.
  - `-d` + CMD → error (exit 2) with a pointer to `./exec.sh` for the detached-container cmd case; `-d` alone is unchanged (`compose up -d TARGET`).
  - Migration: `./run.sh runtime` → `./run.sh -t runtime`. `./run.sh test` → `./run.sh -t test`. Plain `./run.sh` still drops into devel bash (unchanged UX).

## [v0.9.13] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`.github/workflows/release-test-tools.yaml`** — on every tag push (and manual `workflow_dispatch`), builds multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) `Dockerfile.test-tools` and publishes to `ghcr.io/ycpss91255-docker/test-tools:<tag>` + `:latest`. First release triggered by this tag; package visibility should be set to public on first push so downstream Dockerfiles can pull anonymously.
- **`TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE` build-arg** in `Dockerfile.example` — defaults to `test-tools:local` (preserves the local `./build.sh` flow that builds `Dockerfile.test-tools` into the host daemon). Override in CI to `ghcr.io/ycpss91255-docker/test-tools:vX.Y.Z` so buildx pulls the arch-correct pre-built image over the wire.

### Changed
- **BREAKING for downstream repos adopting v0.9.13+ workflows**: `build-worker.yaml` no longer builds `test-tools:local` in-job. Instead it parses the template version from `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_REF` and passes `TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ycpss91255-docker/test-tools:<template-ver>` as a build-arg to the test stage. Downstream Dockerfiles must add `ARG TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE="test-tools:local"` + `FROM ${TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE} AS test-tools-stage` + `COPY --from=test-tools-stage` (the previous `COPY --from=test-tools:local` literal stops working once repos bump their `main.yaml` `@tag` to `v0.9.13`). Existing repos pinned to `@v0.9.12` or earlier remain unaffected until they upgrade.
- `Dockerfile.example` test stage restructured: new `FROM ${TEST_TOOLS_IMAGE} AS test-tools-stage` alias, 4 `COPY --from=test-tools:local` → `COPY --from=test-tools-stage`, top-level comment updated.

### Fixed
- **CI `COPY --from=test-tools:local` no longer fails with `pull access denied` on downstream repos** (follow-up to v0.9.12 `load: true` attempt, which turned out not to share images between buildx steps — [docker/build-push-action#581](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action/issues/581)). GHCR-backed approach sidesteps the cross-step image-store isolation entirely.
- **`release-test-tools.yaml` Dockerfile path** — was wrongly written as `template/dockerfile/Dockerfile.test-tools` (the downstream subtree path); in the template repo itself the file is at `dockerfile/Dockerfile.test-tools`. Regression test added to assert no subtree-prefixed path leaks back in.

## [v0.9.12] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — weekly `github-actions` ecosystem scan so template's own consumed actions (`actions/checkout`, `docker/*`, etc.) stay current without manual audits.

### Changed
- README "Updating" section (4 languages) clarifies that `./template/upgrade.sh` already automates subtree pull + integrity check + `init.sh` resync + `main.yaml` `@vX.Y.Z` sed; hand-rolling `git subtree pull` is discouraged since the sed + init steps are easy to forget. Adds a Dependabot snippet downstream repos can drop into their `.github/dependabot.yml` so template version bumps surface as PRs automatically (Dependabot handles workflow refs only; subtree still needs `upgrade.sh`).

### Fixed
- **`build-worker.yaml` test-tools build now uses `load: true`.** Without it, `docker/build-push-action@v6` with `push: false` discards the built image, so subsequent `COPY --from=test-tools:local` in the downstream Dockerfile can't resolve the tag. buildx then falls back to registry pull → `docker.io/library/test-tools:local: pull access denied` → CI fail. Surfaced when `ros1_bridge` became the first downstream repo to adopt `test-tools:local` post-v0.9.11 (issue #106 migration PR). Added `test/unit/template_spec.bats` regression test asserting the `load: true` flag is present.

## [v0.9.11] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed
- **`_lib.sh` fallback `_detect_lang` returned `"zh"` for `zh_TW` (issue
  #103)** — a copy-paste typo in the fallback used when `i18n.sh` was
  absent (the Dockerfile `/lint` stage). Fixed to `"zh-TW"`. The
  follow-up `#104` dedupe below then REMOVED the fallback entirely; the
  only remaining `_detect_lang` is in `i18n.sh`.

### Changed
- **`[build] network` now defaults to `auto` (issue #102)**. On Jetson
  (detected via `/etc/nv_tegra_release`) setup.sh resolves `auto` to
  `host`, so first-time `./build.sh` succeeds without the DNS failures
  that Jetson's broken bridge NAT used to cause. Desktop hosts stay on
  Docker's default bridge. Explicit `host` / `bridge` / `none` /
  `default` still pass through unchanged; new `off` value for explicit
  opt-out. New `_resolve_build_network` helper mirrors
  `_resolve_runtime`'s Jetson-aware pattern.
- **`_detect_lang` deduplicated: single canonical definition in
  `i18n.sh` (issue #104)**. Previously `build.sh` / `run.sh` /
  `exec.sh` / `stop.sh` / `_lib.sh` each shipped an inline fallback
  `_detect_lang` for when `i18n.sh` wasn't reachable (Dockerfile
  `/lint` stage). That invited drift — see #103 where `_lib.sh`'s
  copy had silently returned `zh` instead of `zh-TW` for months.
  `Dockerfile.example`'s test stage now COPYs `_lib.sh` + `i18n.sh` +
  `_tui_conf.sh` alongside `*.sh`; scripts look up `_lib.sh` in the
  template layout OR as a sibling, with a clear error when neither
  exists. Downstream repos using a custom Dockerfile (not based on
  `Dockerfile.example`) need to mirror this COPY in their test stage.
- **`_sanitize_lang` warning now localises to the system `$LANG`**. v0.9.7
  Agent A scoped this helper out of i18n; a user with `LANG=zh_TW.UTF-8`
  who typed `--lang xxx` still saw an English WARNING. Now we re-detect
  from the system env (can't trust `_LANG` — it holds the invalid input
  the user just passed) and print the warning in zh-TW / zh-CN / ja
  where applicable, falling back to English for other locales.

### Added
- **Coverage audit follow-up (+9 unit tests)**. Kcov run flagged four
  small untested branches in `_lib.sh` and `_tui_conf.sh`; filling them
  raised non-TUI coverage from 94.4% → 95.7%. New tests:
  - `_lib_msg count` / `caps` translation keys exercised in all four
    languages (previously only Files / Identity / etc. were asserted).
  - `_mount_container_path` helper — four cases (plain /
    with-mode / env-var-interpolated / no-colon fallback). The symmetric
    `_mount_host_path` was already covered; the container-side parser
    had zero unit tests.
  - `_upsert_conf_value` "section not found" branch — appends a fresh
    `[section]` header + key when called against a conf that doesn't
    yet have that section.
  - `_upsert_conf_value` "section present, key absent at EOF" branch —
    appends the key to the last section when target key isn't there.
  - `_write_setup_conf` final-section override flush — an override key
    whose target is the LAST section in the template gets emitted
    via the EOF-flush path (previously only the mid-file append branch
    was asserted).
  - `_write_setup_conf` removed_keys + flush interplay — ensures a key
    listed in `removed_keys` does NOT reappear via the EOF flush.

  TUI interactive flows (`_edit_section_*`) in `setup_tui.sh` remain
  at ~17% — they require a dialog/whiptail stub framework to drive,
  cost doesn't justify coverage-for-its-own-sake. `setup_tui.sh`
  validators / I/O helpers are covered at unit level via `tui_spec`.

## [v0.9.10] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Multi-arch support in `build-worker.yaml`** — new `platforms` input
  (default `"linux/amd64"`, accepts `"linux/amd64,linux/arm64"`). Each
  requested platform runs as a parallel matrix shard on its own native
  runner (amd64 → `ubuntu-latest`, arm64 → `ubuntu-24.04-arm`), so arm64
  builds avoid QEMU emulation and stay in the 5-15 min range instead of
  30-60 min. Full pipeline (test-tools → test stage smoke → devel →
  runtime) runs natively per platform. Covers Jetson (Nano / Xavier /
  Orin, all aarch64) and modern Raspberry Pi (4 / 5 on 64-bit OS) and
  standard x86 hosts. 32-bit ARM (armv7/v6) intentionally unsupported —
  no native runner exists and QEMU emulation would balloon CI time;
  modern Pi defaults to 64-bit OS.

### Changed
- **`build-worker.yaml` now uses the `docker-container` buildx driver**
  (was `docker`). Required for multi-arch builds. Side effect:
  `test-tools:local` is built via `docker/build-push-action@v6` (not
  plain `docker build`) so the tag lands in buildx's internal image
  store, visible to the subsequent test-stage build's
  `COPY --from=test-tools:local` on the same builder.
- **Matrix job names**: per-platform shards are called
  `call-docker-build / build (linux/amd64)` etc. A stable-name
  aggregator job `call-docker-build / docker-build` gates on all
  shards — downstream `main` branch protection rules that require
  `call-docker-build / docker-build` keep working without changes.

## [v0.9.9] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **`[deploy] runtime` setup.conf key** — Docker runtime override at
  service level in compose.yaml. Required on Jetson (JetPack) because
  its nvidia-container-toolkit runs in csv mode and refuses the modern
  `--gpus` flow that `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` uses.
  Values:
  - `auto` — emit `runtime: nvidia` on Jetson (detected via
    `/etc/nv_tegra_release`), omit on desktop (default).
  - `nvidia` — force emit on all hosts (e.g. csv-mode toolkit on x86).
  - `off` — never emit (Docker default runc).

  `setup.sh` resolves via new `_detect_jetson` + `_resolve_runtime`
  helpers; `SETUP_DETECT_JETSON=true|false` env var overrides the
  filesystem probe (used by tests). `setup_tui.sh` gains a matching
  picker in `[deploy]` section with 4-language i18n;
  `_validate_runtime` accepts `auto|nvidia|off` or empty.

### Changed
- **`_lib.sh` `_print_config_summary` now honours `${_LANG}`**. Previously
  the build/run config summary (Files / Identity / Resolved / Customize
  sections, plus user / hardware / workspace / GPU enabled / GUI enabled
  / network / privileged labels) was hardcoded English regardless of
  `--lang` / `SETUP_LANG`. Agent A's v0.9.7 i18n PR explicitly scoped
  this out as "too much to bite off"; user feedback after the Jetson
  upgrade: `./run.sh --lang zh-TW` still looked English because the
  summary is 90% of the output. A new `_lib_msg` translation table
  covers `en` / `zh-TW` / `zh-CN` / `ja`. Technical identifiers kept
  untranslated: file names (`setup.conf` / `.env` / `compose.yaml`),
  INI section names (`[image]` / ...), `.env` variable names (`TZ`,
  `APT_MIRROR_*`, `IPC`, `CAPS`), and command strings in the Customize
  hint.

## [v0.9.8] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **`upgrade.sh` no longer leaves the repo destroyed if `git subtree
  pull` misbehaves**. On Jetson L4T (ships an older `git-subtree.sh`),
  running `upgrade.sh v0.9.5 → v0.9.7` fast-forwarded the synthetic
  squash commit onto HEAD, moving `template/*` to repo root and
  deleting repo-specific files (Dockerfile, compose.yaml, bridge.yaml,
  etc.). `upgrade.sh` now:
  - **Pre-flight** — fails fast with actionable messages when `git
    config user.name / user.email` is unset (a Jetson-specific trigger
    for the partial-state bug), or when a merge / rebase / cherry-pick
    is in progress (`.git/MERGE_HEAD`, `.git/rebase-merge`, etc.).
  - **Post-flight integrity check** — after the subtree pull, verifies
    `template/.version`, `template/init.sh`, and
    `template/script/docker/setup.sh` still exist. If any is missing,
    hard-resets to the pre-pull HEAD and exits with a diagnostic. The
    working tree is restored; no manual cleanup required.
  - **Step numbering** — corrected from mixed "1/4 / 2/3 / 3/3" to
    "1/4 / 2/4 / 3/4 / 4/4".
- **`test/unit/upgrade_spec.bats`** gains 12 regression tests covering
  the three new guards + structural invariants (ordering: identity
  check before pull, integrity check after pull, HEAD snapshotted for
  rollback).
- **`test/integration/upgrade_spec.bats`** (new, 6 tests) drives the
  real `upgrade.sh` end-to-end against a fake template remote (bare
  repo with `v0.9.5` / `v0.9.7` tags) attached to a sandbox downstream
  repo. Covers happy path (version bump, new content, `main.yaml`
  `@tag` rewrite), idempotent re-run, `--check`, the two pre-flight
  guards, and the destructive-FF rollback (stubs `git-subtree pull`
  via `GIT_EXEC_PATH` to simulate the Jetson bug, asserts repo is
  restored to pre-pull HEAD). Total: 592 → 610 (+12 unit + 6
  integration).

## [v0.9.7] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- **Full i18n coverage for `build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh`**.
  Previously only `usage()` (help text) honoured `--lang` / `SETUP_LANG`;
  runtime log lines (`First run — bootstrapping`, `regenerating .env /
  compose.yaml`, `ERROR: setup did not produce .env`, `Container is
  already running`, `is not running`, `No instances found`, ...) were
  hardcoded English regardless of language. Each script now ships a
  local `_msg()` translation table covering `en` / `zh-TW` / `zh-CN` /
  `ja`, matching the existing `setup.sh` pattern. English remains the
  default when no flag / env var is set, so existing tooling and CI
  output are unchanged.

### Added
- **Root-level `setup.sh` symlink**. `init.sh` now links
  `<repo>/setup.sh` to `template/script/docker/setup.sh` alongside the
  existing `build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh` / `setup_tui.sh`
  / `Makefile` symlinks. Consumer repos can now invoke `./setup.sh`
  directly for scripted / CI regeneration of `.env` + `compose.yaml`,
  instead of relying on the indirect `./build.sh --setup` or
  `./setup_tui.sh` Save paths.
- **`setup.sh -h` / `--help`**. `script/docker/setup.sh` gains a
  `usage()` block documenting `--base-path` and `--lang`, following the
  existing `build.sh` case-per-`_LANG` scaffolding (English-only for
  now; future translations plug in via the existing `_msg` framework).
- **`test/unit/exec_sh_spec.bats`** (18 tests) and
  **`test/unit/stop_sh_spec.bats`** (17 tests): new unit specs
  covering argument parsing, the container-running precheck hints in
  `exec.sh`, the `--all` / `--instance` branches in `stop.sh`, all
  four languages of usage text, runtime log-line i18n, and the
  fallback `_detect_lang` branches (`LANG=zh_TW.UTF-8` etc. when
  `template/` is absent).
- Log-line i18n regression tests in `test/unit/build_sh_spec.bats`
  (+7) and `test/unit/run_sh_spec.bats` (+6) assert that `--lang
  <code>` actually translates the runtime logs (bootstrap, drift-regen,
  err_no_env, already-running), not just `--help`.

### Fixed
- **`setup.sh` symlink-invocation robustness**. `setup.sh` previously
  located its `i18n.sh` / `_tui_conf.sh` siblings and the template
  `setup.conf` via `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"`, which resolved to the
  repo root when the script was invoked through `<repo>/setup.sh`
  (symlink). `setup.sh` now runs `readlink -f` once at load and stores
  the real script directory in `_SETUP_SCRIPT_DIR`; every sibling
  source and template-relative path reads from that variable.

## [v0.9.6] - 2026-04-23

### Added
- **`[build] network` setup.conf key**: overrides Docker's build-time
  network mode. Empty (default) = Docker decides (bridge + NAT). Set
  to `host` when the host's bridge NAT is unusable: stripped embedded
  kernels (e.g. Jetson L4T missing `iptable_raw`), hosts with
  `"iptables": false` in daemon.json, or firewall-locked CI runners.
  `setup.sh` writes `BUILD_NETWORK=<value>` to `.env` and emits
  `build.network: <value>` under each service in `compose.yaml`;
  `build.sh` forwards `--network <value>` to the auxiliary
  `docker build` invocation for `test-tools`. `setup_tui.sh` gains a
  matching `[build] Build network` menu item and
  `_validate_build_network` validator (accepts empty / `host` /
  `bridge` / `none` / `default`).
- **Integration test** `fresh_clone_portability_spec.bats` covers the
  fresh-clone-on-a-different-machine path end-to-end (real `build.sh`
  + `setup.sh`, no mocks): both the stale-absolute-path auto-migrate
  and the portable `${WS_PATH}` round-trip.

### Changed
- **`_dump_conf_section` hides empty-valued keys** in the
  `_print_config_summary` output. Lines like `shm_size =` (using the
  template default) are noise in the config dump; they're now
  filtered. Sections whose every key is empty collapse to nothing and
  the section header is skipped too (via the existing
  `[[ -z ${_content} ]]` check in the caller).

## [v0.9.5] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- **`build.sh` / `run.sh` auto-regenerate on drift**. `_check_setup_drift`
  now returns non-zero when `setup.conf` / GPU / GUI / USER_UID drifted
  from `.env`; the drift branch in `build.sh` / `run.sh` re-runs
  `setup.sh` automatically instead of printing a WARNING and continuing
  with stale `.env`. `.env` + `compose.yaml` are derived artifacts with
  no user-owned data to preserve, so re-running is always safe. Fixes
  the footgun where `git pull` + `./build.sh` silently used the
  previous machine's `WS_PATH`. Users who preferred the warn-only
  behaviour can still edit `.env` freely — drift is only re-triggered
  by changes to `setup.conf` or detected hardware, not by editing
  `.env` directly.

## [v0.9.4] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **`[volumes] mount_1` portability**: `setup.sh` used to bake the
  absolute host workspace path into `setup.conf` on first-time
  bootstrap. Committing that file broke fresh clones on any other
  machine whose filesystem layout differed — `_load_env` resolved
  `WS_PATH` to a directory that doesn't exist and docker tried to
  mount it. `setup.sh` now writes `mount_1` in the portable
  `${WS_PATH}:/home/${USER_NAME}/work` form so docker-compose resolves
  `${WS_PATH}` per-machine from `.env`. When a stale absolute path
  (baked from another machine, absent locally) is encountered,
  `setup.sh` warns and auto-migrates `mount_1` back to the portable
  form. Users who intentionally pin an existing absolute path still
  get that value honored.

## [v0.9.3] - 2026-04-23

### BREAKING
- **`template/VERSION` renamed to `template/.version`**. Dotfile keeps
  version metadata out of casual `ls`. Clean break — `upgrade.sh` /
  `init.sh` / `build-worker.yaml` no longer read `template/VERSION` or
  the even older `.template_version`. Downstream repos pick up the
  rename automatically via `./template/upgrade.sh <new-tag>`: the
  subtree pull drops `template/VERSION` and lands `template/.version`,
  and the new `upgrade.sh`/`init.sh` code reads the new location.
  Anyone running the old `upgrade.sh` binary against the new tag sees
  "unknown" as the local version — cosmetic only, the upgrade still
  succeeds.

### Changed
- **Codecov config consolidated** into `.codecov.yaml`. Historical
  duplicate `codecov.yml` removed — Codecov precedence had it silently
  overriding `.codecov.yaml` since PR #62, so the strict `ignore:` +
  `patch: 100%` rules in `.codecov.yaml` were dead config. `.codecov.yaml`
  now carries the relaxed policy from `codecov.yml` (threshold 1%,
  patch informational) plus the previously-ignored `test/**` and
  `.github/**` ignores. No behavior change for contributors.

## [v0.9.2] - 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **`build.sh` / `run.sh` bootstrap**: fresh clones (where `compose.yaml`
  is gitignored since v0.9.0) now bootstrap correctly. Two regressions
  fixed:
  1. Bootstrap condition now also checks `compose.yaml`; previously a
     clone with `.env` + `setup.conf` present but `compose.yaml` absent
     skipped to the drift-check path and died in `_load_env` with a
     cryptic "No such file" error.
  2. Bootstrap path no longer dispatches through `_run_interactive`,
     which on a TTY launches `setup_tui.sh`. A user who pressed
     Esc / Ctrl+C in the TUI previously ended up with no `.env`.
     Bootstrap now calls `setup.sh` directly; TUI stays reserved for
     the explicit `--setup` flag.
- **`build.sh` / `run.sh` defensive guard**: if `setup.sh` returns
  without producing `.env` (cancelled TUI, setup crash, …), surface a
  clear error pointing at `--setup` instead of failing deep in
  `_load_env`.

## [v0.9.1] - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- **`upgrade.sh` / `init.sh` default to HTTPS** for the template remote
  (`https://github.com/ycpss91255-docker/template.git`). Fresh clones /
  CI runners / first-time contributors no longer need an SSH key to
  `./template/upgrade.sh`. Override with `TEMPLATE_REMOTE=git@...` env
  var for private forks or SSH-agent setups. 4-language READMEs and
  `init.sh` docstring updated accordingly.

## [v0.9.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added (Wave 1 + Wave 2 — 2026-04-22)
- **GPU MIG detection** (`_detect_mig` / `_list_gpu_instances` in
  `_tui_conf.sh`): when host has NVIDIA MIG mode enabled, the deploy
  editor opens with a msgbox listing GPU / MIG instance UUIDs and
  advising `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<MIG-UUID>` via `[environment]`
  since `count=N` targets whole GPUs only
- **`[build] tz` key**: container timezone exposed as a setup.conf
  value; pipes through to compose.yaml `build.args` as
  `TZ: ${TZ:-Asia/Taipei}`. Empty keeps Dockerfile default
- **`[devices] cgroup_rule_*`**: `device_cgroup_rules:` block for USB
  hotplug / dynamic device nodes; TUI devices editor now has a
  sub-menu to pick between device bindings and cgroup rules. New
  `_validate_cgroup_rule` validator

### Changed
- `[image] rule_*` dedup on write: re-adding a rule that already
  exists at another slot moves it to the new position instead of
  leaving two identical entries
- `_edit_list_section` add now reuses empty slots (e.g. cleared
  `mount_1` after user opted out of workspace), preventing the next
  mount from leapfrogging to `mount_2`
- TUI image-rule type picker simplified to function names only
  (`prefix` / `suffix` / `@basename` / `@default`); format + example
  shown in the value inputbox
- TUI footer buttons (`Save` / `Enter` / `Cancel`) no longer i18n'd;
  consistent English across all locales
- `_TUI_LANG_UPPER` initialised at source time so sourcing `setup_tui.sh`
  and calling a section editor directly (tests, REPL) no longer
  crashes on unbound variable under `set -u`
- **CLI consistency**: `exec.sh` / `stop.sh` now accept `--lang LANG`
  (matches `build.sh` / `run.sh`); `stop.sh` gains `-a` short flag
  for `--all` (matches common CLI patterns). Unknown lang values
  warn and fall back to `en` via `_sanitize_lang`
- **`--gen-image-conf` alias removed** from `init.sh` / `upgrade.sh`;
  the `--gen-conf` name is the only spelling. The alias was a
  rename-artifact and not documented outside in-tree help
- **`tui.sh` → `setup_tui.sh`**: pairs with `setup.sh` and makes the
  "interactive editor for setup.conf" relationship explicit.
  `init.sh` now creates `setup_tui.sh` and removes any stale `tui.sh`
  symlink left behind by pre-rename installs
- **`_print_config_summary` full dump**: `build.sh` / `run.sh` now
  print every populated `setup.conf` section (image / build / deploy /
  gui / network / security / resources / environment / tmpfs /
  devices / volumes) alongside identity, file paths, and the resolved
  GPU/GUI/TZ flags — so users see every value this run consumes
  without having to diff `.env` or run `docker compose config`

### Added
- **`[build] target_arch` TARGETARCH override**: new scalar key
  alongside the `arg_N` list. Non-empty value pins Docker's
  `TARGETARCH` build arg for both the main image and the test-tools
  image (main via compose `build.args`, test-tools via
  `build.sh --build-arg`). Empty (default) leaves BuildKit's
  auto-detection intact. Valid values: `amd64` / `arm64` / `arm` /
  `386` / `ppc64le` / `s390x` / `riscv64`. `setup_tui.sh` → Build
  adds a dedicated menu entry; `_validate_target_arch` catches typos
  like `aarch64` / `x86_64` (BuildKit uses `arm64` / `amd64`).
- **`Dockerfile.test-tools` multi-arch**: `ARG TARGETARCH=amd64`
  branches the ShellCheck + Hadolint download URLs via a `case`
  statement. BuildKit auto-fills on amd64 / arm64 hosts; falls back
  to amd64 binaries on legacy builders. Rejects unsupported arches
  loudly instead of silently grabbing a wrong-arch binary
- **`setup_tui.sh --lang <invalid>` surfaces a TUI msgbox** before
  the main menu opens. Previously the `_sanitize_lang` stderr warning
  scrolled away as soon as dialog/whiptail cleared the screen; the
  user saw a silently-English TUI with no hint why. New
  `_warn_if_lang_rejected` helper captures the raw input and opens a
  "Language fallback" msgbox listing the valid codes

### Performance
- **`make test` no longer runs kcov** — the dev loop pays for bats +
  shellcheck only. `make coverage` keeps the full kcov path for CI
  and release checks. `ci.sh --ci` honors `$COVERAGE=1` to include
  kcov when the outer `--coverage` flag is set
- **`bats --jobs $(nproc)` parallelism** — GNU parallel runs the
  524-test suite concurrently across files and within files. All
  specs already use per-test `mktemp -d` dirs so there's no shared
  filesystem state. Combined effect (cached apt):
  before ~1m27s (serial + kcov) → now ~42s (parallel, no kcov) ≈ 2x
  faster on the dev loop

### BREAKING
- **Language code `zh` renamed to `zh-TW`** (BCP-47). `--lang zh`
  no longer accepted; use `--lang zh-TW` (Taiwan Traditional).
  `zh-CN` / `ja` / `en` unchanged
- **`@env_example` image-name rule removed**: legacy rule that read
  `IMAGE_NAME` from `.env.example` deleted along with its TUI option
  + i18n keys. `.env` is a setup.sh-derived artifact so the rule
  created a cycle. Replace with explicit `rule_N = @default:<name>`
  or set `IMAGE_NAME` directly

### Removed (tried, reverted)
- **B7 vim keybindings** (attempted `DIALOGRC bindkey j/k/h/l`):
  reverted in `ccc0dbc`. `dialog` 1.3 rejects letter curses_keys —
  only symbolic names (`TAB` / `DOWN` / `UP` / `ENTER`) are valid.
  See repo-root `TODO.md` for alternative-backend options (gum /
  fzf / textual) queued for a future PR

### Changed (TUI UX 重構 — 2026-04-21 本地)
- **主選單重組**：11 項平鋪 → 5 常用（network / deploy / gui / volumes /
  environment）+ `advanced` 子選單（image / build / devices / tmpfs /
  security）
- **Save UX**：去掉 `__save` menu item，改用 dialog/whiptail 的
  `--extra-button --extra-label "Save & Exit"`（exit code 3 = save
  訊號，0 = 進選中項，1 = Cancel）
- **List sections 統一 single-layer**：volumes / environment / devices /
  tmpfs / ports 點 item 直接 inputbox；**空值 + OK = mark_removed**
  （該 key 從 setup.conf 消失）；list menu 只保留 Add / Back
- **Conditional triggers**：`shm_size` 不再是主選單項，改為
  `[network] ipc != host` 時從 network 結尾彈出；`ports` 改為
  `mode == bridge` 時從 network 結尾彈出
- **privileged 遷移**：從 `[network] privileged` 搬到新 `[security]
  privileged`。TUI 的 privileged yesno 由 Advanced → Security 編輯
- **`[security]` 新 section**：privileged / cap_add_* / cap_drop_* /
  security_opt_*。先前 compose.yaml 硬編的 SYS_ADMIN / NET_ADMIN /
  MKNOD / seccomp:unconfined 改為 setup.conf template 預設值，可由
  TUI 或手編調整

### Removed
- **cgroup (`device_cgroup_rules`)**：setup.conf 註解、parser、TUI、
  compose.yaml `device_cgroup_rules:` 產生邏輯全拿掉。使用者手寫
  `cgroup_N = ...` 會被忽略

### Added
- **Interactive TUI** (`setup_tui.sh`) for editing `<repo>/setup.conf` via
  dialog (with whiptail fallback). Main menu + direct-jump subcommands
  (`./setup_tui.sh image|build|network|deploy|gui|volumes`). Validates
  mount format, GPU count, and enum fields before save. On save,
  invokes `setup.sh` automatically to regenerate `.env` +
  `compose.yaml`. Symlinked from each repo root via `init.sh`.
  4-language i18n (en / zh / zh-CN / ja).
- **`_tui_backend.sh`** — dialog/whiptail abstraction
  (`_tui_menu`, `_tui_radiolist`, `_tui_checklist`, `_tui_inputbox`,
  `_tui_yesno`, `_tui_msgbox`). Preferred backend auto-detected;
  exits with install hint when neither is installed.
- **`_tui_conf.sh`** — pure-logic INI read/write helpers:
  `_load_setup_conf_full` (full file with section order preserved),
  `_write_setup_conf` (comment-preserving overwrite),
  `_upsert_conf_value` (single-key in-place edit), plus validators
  (`_validate_mount`, `_validate_gpu_count`, `_validate_enum`) and
  mount-string parsers.
- **`[build]` section** in `setup.conf` for Dockerfile build args
  (`apt_mirror_ubuntu`, `apt_mirror_debian`). Empty value keeps the
  hard-coded Taiwan mirror defaults.
- **Workspace writeback**: on first run (when `<repo>/setup.conf` does
  not exist), `setup.sh` detects the workspace host path, copies
  `template/setup.conf` to `<repo>/setup.conf`, and writes the
  detected workspace into `[volumes] mount_1`. Subsequent runs read
  `mount_1` as the source of truth. Clearing `mount_1` is treated as
  opt-out; the workspace is omitted from `compose.yaml` and `setup.sh`
  does not re-populate it.
- `build.sh` / `run.sh` `--setup` / `-s` is now **TTY-aware**: under
  an interactive terminal with `setup_tui.sh` available, it launches the
  TUI; otherwise it runs `setup.sh` non-interactively (unchanged
  behaviour for CI / non-TTY).
- `init.sh _create_symlinks` adds `setup_tui.sh` alongside the existing
  five symlinks.
- **Single `setup.conf`** at repo root consolidates all runtime
  configuration consumed by `setup.sh`: `[image]`, `[build]`,
  `[deploy]`, `[gui]`, `[network]`, `[volumes]`. Template default
  lives at `template/setup.conf`; per-repo override at
  `<repo>/setup.conf` uses section-level replace strategy (a section
  present in the per-repo file fully replaces the template's section;
  omitted sections fall back to template).
- `setup.sh` new helpers: `_parse_ini_section`, `_load_setup_conf`,
  `_get_conf_value`, `_get_conf_list_sorted`, `_resolve_gpu`,
  `_resolve_gui`, `detect_gui`, `_compute_conf_hash`,
  `_check_setup_drift`, and `generate_compose_yaml`. `setup.sh` now
  emits a full `compose.yaml` alongside `.env` with conditional GPU
  `deploy` block, conditional GUI env/volumes, and extra volumes from
  `[volumes]` section.
- **Drift detection** via `.env` metadata: setup.sh writes
  `SETUP_CONF_HASH`, `SETUP_GUI_DETECTED`, `SETUP_TIMESTAMP` into
  `.env`; `build.sh` / `run.sh` compare stored values against current
  state and warn when `setup.conf` was modified, GPU/GUI detection
  changed, or UID changed. Warnings are non-blocking; user re-runs with
  `--setup` to regenerate.
- `build.sh` / `run.sh` **`--setup`** (`-s`) flag: forces setup.sh to
  regenerate `.env` + `compose.yaml`. Default behaviour: auto-bootstrap
  on missing `.env` (first run / CI fresh clone); warn on drift if
  `.env` exists.
- `init.sh` new option: `--gen-conf` copies `template/setup.conf` to
  `<repo>/setup.conf` for per-repo override. `--gen-image-conf` is kept
  as a back-compat alias.
- New unit spec `test/unit/compose_gen_spec.bats` (14 tests) covering
  `generate_compose_yaml` conditional output.

### Changed
- **PR #74's `template/config/setup/` directory removed**: the
  separate `image_name.conf` / `gpu.conf` / `gui.conf` / `network.conf`
  / `volumes.conf` files introduced in #74 are consolidated into a
  single `setup.conf` INI. `config/` now strictly contains container
  internal configs (bashrc, tmux, pip, terminator); runtime wiring
  lives at repo root alongside `Dockerfile`.
- `compose.yaml` is now a **derived artifact** (gitignored) generated
  by `setup.sh` on every invocation. Users inspect it for the current
  effective runtime config; source of truth is `setup.conf`.
- **BREAKING — setup.conf section rename**:
  `[image_name]` → `[image]`; `[gpu]` → `[deploy]` with keys prefixed
  (`mode` → `gpu_mode`, `count` → `gpu_count`,
  `capabilities` → `gpu_capabilities`). Also introduces `[build]`
  (apt mirrors). Template `setup.conf` updated; per-repo overrides
  must use the new names.
- `detect_image_name` now reads `[image] rules` (comma-separated
  ordered list) from `setup.conf` instead of a dedicated
  `image_name.conf` rule file. Rule semantics unchanged
  (`prefix:`, `suffix:`, `@env_example`, `@basename`, `@default:`).
- `build.sh` / `run.sh`: removed `--no-env` flag (semantic reversed —
  setup.sh no longer runs by default, so the opposite `--setup` flag
  was introduced). `exec.sh` / `stop.sh` unchanged (container state is
  already frozen when they run).
- `write_env` signature expanded with new columns written to `.env`:
  `NETWORK_MODE`, `IPC_MODE`, `PRIVILEGED`, `GPU_COUNT`,
  `GPU_CAPABILITIES`, `SETUP_CONF_HASH`, `SETUP_GUI_DETECTED`,
  `SETUP_TIMESTAMP`.
- `generate_compose_yaml` baseline: only `${WS_PATH}:/home/${USER_NAME}/work`
  is always emitted; `/dev:/dev` now lives in `setup.conf`'s
  `[volumes]` template default (user-replaceable). GUI-related
  volumes/env are emitted iff `[gui] mode` resolves enabled.
- Version tracking moved from `.template_version` (repo root, manually
  maintained) to `template/VERSION` (inside subtree, auto-synced by
  `git subtree pull`). `init.sh` and `upgrade.sh` automatically clean up
  the legacy `.template_version` file. `build-worker.yaml` reads
  `template/VERSION` with `.template_version` fallback for transition.

### Documentation
- README (4 languages) and `init.sh` header now document the full
  bootstrap sequence for a brand-new repo: `git init` + an empty initial
  commit must run before `git subtree add`, otherwise subtree fails with
  `ambiguous argument 'HEAD'` and `working tree has modifications`.

### Removed
- `template/config/image_name.conf` (content absorbed into
  `template/setup.conf` under `[image_name] rules =`).
- `--no-env` flag on `build.sh` / `run.sh` (replaced by default
  no-run-setup + opt-in `--setup`).

### Fixed
- `test/smoke/test_helper.bash`: `assert_cmd_installed` now returns `1`
  after calling `fail`, so callers can short-circuit via `|| return 1`
  instead of silently falling through. `assert_cmd_runs` and
  `assert_pip_pkg` now short-circuit when the target command is missing,
  so they no longer execute `run <missing-cmd>` and emit a spurious
  Bats BW01 warning.
- `test/unit/lib_spec.bats`, `test/unit/pip_setup_spec.bats`,
  `test/unit/setup_spec.bats`: replace `run <cmd>` / `assert_failure`
  pairs with `run -127 <cmd>` on the five tests whose command is
  expected to exit 127 (`_load_env` missing arg, `_compose` on empty
  PATH, `pip setup.sh` without pip, `setup.sh main --base-path` /
  `--lang` missing value). Silences Bats BW01. Files that use `run -N`
  flags now declare `bats_require_minimum_version 1.5.0` to silence
  BW02.

## [v0.8.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `upgrade.sh`: drop the auto-appended `Co-Authored-By: Claude ...`
  trailer from the `chore: update template references` commit message.
  AI-attribution lines are visual noise for reviewers and the project
  convention is to omit them everywhere (PR body, commit message, code).

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- `test/smoke/test_helper.bash`: shared runtime assertion helpers for
  downstream-repo smoke specs — `assert_cmd_installed`, `assert_cmd_runs`,
  `assert_file_exists`, `assert_dir_exists`, `assert_file_owned_by`,
  `assert_pip_pkg`. Each prints a decorated diagnostic on failure so the
  bats log points at the exact missing artifact. Keeps downstream smoke
  specs terse and self-documenting.
- `init.sh` new-repo skeleton now emits two sample smoke assertions
  (`entrypoint.sh is installed and executable`, `bash is available on
  PATH`) demonstrating the shared helpers, instead of one bare
  `[ -x /entrypoint.sh ]` assertion.
- `test/unit/ci_spec.bats` (5 tests): covers `script/ci/ci.sh`
  `_install_deps` — happy path plus the three explicit error branches
  for `apt-get update` / `apt-get install` / `git clone bats-mock`.
- `test/unit/smoke_helper_spec.bats` (19 tests): unit coverage for every
  runtime assertion helper above, including failure paths.
- `test/unit/setup_spec.bats`: 3 new `detect_ws_path` cases — explicit
  ERROR on missing `base_path`, and path-normalization coverage for
  strategies 1 and 3 when the input contains `..` segments.
- `test/unit/init_spec.bats` (15 tests): unit coverage for `init.sh`
  helpers previously reachable only through the Level-1 integration
  test — `_detect_template_version` (git-remote parsing, failure
  paths, rc-tag filtering), `_create_version_file` (parameterized
  version, `unknown` fallback, overwrite), `_create_new_repo`
  (workflow `@ref` threading including empty-ref → `@main` fallback),
  and `_create_symlinks` (full symlink set, stale-file replacement,
  custom `.hadolint.yaml` preservation).
- `test/unit/ci_spec.bats`: 3 new `_run_shellcheck` tests — wired-file
  regression guard, `script/docker/*.sh` discovery via `find`, and
  strict-mode propagation on lint failure.

### Fixed
- `init.sh`: stop hard-coding `v0.5.0` as the fallback version in the
  generated `main.yaml`. Workflow refs now fall back to the `main` branch
  (a valid git ref) when no tag is detected, instead of an arbitrary old
  tag. Version detection is done once up-front and shared between
  `.template_version` and the reusable-workflow `@ref`.
- `script/docker/setup.sh` `detect_ws_path`: normalize `base_path` with
  `cd ... && pwd -P` before composing sibling/parent paths, so relative
  or `..`-laden inputs do not produce surprising matches. Emits a clear
  error when the base path does not exist.
- `script/docker/setup.sh`: use `${0:-}` consistently in the
  `BASH_SOURCE == $0` guard (line 400) for parity with line 51.
- `script/ci/ci.sh` `_install_deps`: emit explicit error messages when
  `apt-get update`, `apt-get install`, or `git clone bats-mock` fails,
  instead of relying on `set -e` to exit silently.

### Changed
- `script/ci/ci.sh`: guard `main "$@"` and `set -euo pipefail` behind a
  `BASH_SOURCE == $0` check so the helpers (`_install_deps`, `_die`) can
  be sourced by unit tests without executing the CI pipeline. Matches
  the pattern already used in `script/docker/setup.sh`.
- `init.sh`: wrap top-level flow in `main()` + `BASH_SOURCE == $0` guard
  so helpers (`_detect_template_version`, `_create_version_file`,
  `_create_new_repo`, `_create_symlinks`) are sourceable from unit
  tests without triggering a full `init.sh` run. Strict mode is also
  gated so sourcing respects the caller's settings. Behaviour when
  invoked directly is unchanged.

## [v0.7.2] - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- Align `build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh` with Google Shell Style
  Guide: wrap top-level logic in a `main()` function with `local` variables,
  fix `case` indentation. Behavior unchanged.
- `config/pip/setup.sh`, `config/shell/tmux/setup.sh`,
  `config/shell/terminator/setup.sh`: drop `-x` from strict mode
  (`set -eux` → `set -euo pipefail`) so docker build logs stay quieter.
  Tracing can still be enabled on demand via `bash -x`.
- `script/ci/ci.sh`: refactor kcov `--exclude-path` into a readable array
  instead of one long comma-joined string. Behavior unchanged.
- Re-indent all `.bats` files under `test/smoke/`, `test/unit/`, and
  `test/integration/` from 4-space to 2-space per Google Shell Style Guide.
  Heredoc bodies untouched. Behavior unchanged; all 247 tests still pass.

## [v0.7.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- `run.sh` foreground devel: `./run.sh` appeared to hang for ~10s after the
  user typed `exit` because the cleanup trap ran `compose down` with the
  default 10s SIGTERM grace period. Pass `-t 0` so the already-exited
  interactive container is killed immediately.

## [v0.7.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- `build.sh` / `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh`: `--dry-run` flag prints the
  `docker` / `docker compose` commands that would run instead of executing them.
  Useful for debugging compose / env / instance resolution without side effects.
- `exec.sh`: precheck refuses with a friendly error pointing at `./run.sh`
  (and `--instance NAME` if applicable) when the target container is not running,
  instead of letting `compose exec` print the cryptic `service "devel" is not running`.

### Changed
- Refactor: extracted shared helpers (`_LANG` setup, `_load_env`, `_compute_project_name`,
  `_compose`, `_compose_project`) into `template/script/docker/_lib.sh`. `build.sh`,
  `run.sh`, `exec.sh`, and `stop.sh` now source `_lib.sh` and call the helpers instead
  of duplicating the same i18n / env-loading / compose-flag boilerplate.
- `exec.sh`: passes the user command as a positional array (`"$@"`) to `compose exec`,
  so arguments containing whitespace are preserved instead of being word-split.
- `run.sh`: trap is now `trap _devel_cleanup EXIT` (calls a named function) instead of
  an inline string-expanded command, matching `build.sh`'s style.

## [v0.6.8] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- `run.sh` / `exec.sh` / `stop.sh`: `--instance NAME` flag for parallel container instances
  - `./run.sh --instance dev2` starts a parallel container alongside the default
  - `./exec.sh --instance dev2 [cmd]` enters that named instance
  - `./stop.sh --instance dev2` stops only that one
  - `./stop.sh --all` stops the default + every named instance for this image
- Project name and container name now include `${INSTANCE_SUFFIX}` so each
  instance has isolated docker compose project (own network/volumes)
- `init.sh`-generated `compose.yaml` uses
  `container_name: ${IMAGE_NAME}${INSTANCE_SUFFIX:-}`
  - Default invocation (no `--instance`) keeps the clean name `${IMAGE_NAME}` —
    backward-compatible with external tools that grep `docker exec ${IMAGE_NAME}`

### Changed
- `run.sh`: foreground devel now refuses to start if a container with the
  default name is already running. Use `./stop.sh` first or pass
  `--instance NAME` to start a parallel one.

### Note
- Existing 17 consumer repos must update their `compose.yaml` to use
  `container_name: ${IMAGE_NAME}${INSTANCE_SUFFIX:-}` (one-line edit) before
  `--instance` works there. Default behavior unchanged until they upgrade.

## [v0.6.7] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- `test/integration/init_new_repo_spec.bats`: 21 Level-1 integration tests
  - Verifies `init.sh` produces a complete repo skeleton in an empty dir
    (Dockerfile, compose.yaml, .env.example, symlinks, doc tree, .github/workflows, etc.)
  - Runs inside the existing `make -f Makefile.ci test` container — no Docker needed
  - Total tests: 180 → 201 (180 unit + 21 integration)
- `.github/workflows/self-test.yaml`: new `integration-e2e` job (Level 2)
  - Runs `init.sh` → `build.sh test` → `build.sh` → `run.sh -d` → `exec.sh` → `stop.sh`
    on a synthetic temp repo, on a real GitHub runner with Docker daemon
  - `release` job now depends on both `test` and `integration-e2e`
- `script/ci/ci.sh`: now also runs `bats test/integration/` alongside `test/unit/`

## [v0.6.6] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- `run.sh`: foreground `devel` mode could not be entered via `./exec.sh` from another terminal
  - Symptom: `service "devel" is not running` even though `docker ps` showed it
  - Root cause: foreground used `compose run --name`, which creates a one-off container
    invisible to `compose exec` (the underlying mechanism behind `./exec.sh`)
  - Fix: foreground `devel` now uses `compose up -d` + `compose exec devel bash`
    + a `trap … down EXIT` to preserve the original "exit shell = container gone" semantic
  - Other targets (`test`, `runtime`, ...) still use `compose run --rm` (one-shot stages
    that don't need exec)
  - `compose.yaml` `container_name: ${IMAGE_NAME}` is unchanged, so external scripts
    that do `docker exec ${IMAGE_NAME}` (e.g. local CI helpers) continue to work

### Removed
- `stop.sh`: orphan-container cleanup `docker rm -f "${IMAGE_NAME}"` no longer needed
  (no more orphan from `compose run --name`)

## [v0.6.5] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- `build.sh`/`run.sh`/`exec.sh`/`stop.sh`: graceful fallback when `i18n.sh` is missing
  - v0.6.1 added `source template/script/docker/i18n.sh` but consumer Dockerfile
    `test` stages do `COPY *.sh /lint/` without the template tree, so the source
    failed and broke smoke tests in all consumer repos
  - Fix: each script checks for i18n.sh and falls back to inline `_detect_lang`
    if missing — no Dockerfile changes required in consumer repos

## [v0.6.4] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- `upgrade.sh`: greedy sed pattern clobbered `release-worker.yaml@<ver>` reference,
  replacing it with `build-worker.yaml@<ver>` and breaking release CI in consumer repos
  - Root cause: `s|template/\.github/workflows/.*@v[0-9.]*|...build-worker.yaml@...|`
    matched both worker references; the dedicated `release-worker` line that follows
    only worked when the first sed didn't already overwrite it
  - Fix: drop the greedy first sed, keep only the per-worker-name targeted seds

## [v0.6.3] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- `upgrade.sh`: `--gen-image-conf` flag (delegates to `init.sh --gen-image-conf`)
  - Lets users copy `image_name.conf` to repo root for per-repo customization
    without needing to remember the init.sh path

## [v0.6.2] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- Remove all `# LCOV_EXCL_*` markers from shell scripts to expose real coverage
  - Coverage now reflects actual instrumented lines (95.76% vs prior masked 100%)
  - 2 new direct-run tests for `tmux/setup.sh` and `terminator/setup.sh` (171 total)
  - Remaining 10 uncovered lines in `setup.sh` are kcov bash backend limitations
    (case `;;` arms, `done` redirect close, child-bash guards)

## [v0.6.1] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- `build.sh`: `--clean-tools` flag to remove `test-tools:local` image after build
- `script/docker/i18n.sh`: shared `_detect_lang()` and `_LANG` initialization
  - Sourced by build.sh, run.sh, exec.sh, stop.sh, setup.sh
  - Eliminates ~28 lines of duplication across 5 scripts
  - Adding a new language now requires editing only one file
- `dockerfile/Dockerfile.test-tools`: include `bats-mock` (jasonkarns v1.2.5)
  - Other repos' smoke tests can now use `stub`/`unstub` for command mocking

### Changed
- `build.sh`: keep `test-tools:local` image by default (was removed on EXIT)
  - Avoids race conditions in parallel builds
  - Subsequent builds skip the test-tools build (Docker layer cache)
  - Use `--clean-tools` to restore old behavior

## [v0.6.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- `build.sh`: `--no-cache` flag for force rebuild (passes to both
  test-tools image build and docker compose build)
- `config/image_name.conf`: rule-driven IMAGE_NAME detection
  - Rule types: `prefix:<value>`, `suffix:<value>`, `@env_example`, `@basename`, `@default:<value>`
  - Per-repo override: place `image_name.conf` in repo root
  - Default rules: `@env_example` → `prefix:docker_` → `suffix:_ws` → `@default:unknown`
- `init.sh --gen-image-conf`: copy template's image_name.conf to repo root
  for per-repo customization

### Changed
- `detect_image_name`: refactored to read rules from `image_name.conf` instead
  of hardcoded logic
- **BREAKING**: `image_name.conf` keywords now require `@` prefix
  (`env_example` → `@env_example`, `basename` → `@basename`) to distinguish
  from user-defined values
- Default conf order: `@env_example` → `prefix:docker_` → `suffix:_ws` → `@default:unknown`
  (`.env.example` highest priority; `@default:unknown` as final fallback
  prints INFO log so users know to set IMAGE_NAME explicitly)
- New `@default:<value>` keyword: explicit fallback value with INFO log
- WARNING only when no rule matches AND no `@default:` set (custom conf scenario)

### Fixed
- `stop.sh`: remove orphan container left by `docker compose run --name`
  (`docker compose down` only cleans up `up`-mode containers, not `run`-mode)
- `upgrade.sh`: re-run `init.sh` after subtree pull to sync symlinks
  (avoids stale symlinks when template directory structure changes)

### Removed
- Stale comments referencing `get_param.sh` (historical, no longer relevant)

## [v0.5.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- `setup.sh`: add `APT_MIRROR_UBUNTU` and `APT_MIRROR_DEBIAN` to `.env`
  - Default: `tw.archive.ubuntu.com` (Ubuntu), `mirror.twds.com.tw` (Debian)
  - Preserves existing values from `.env` on re-run
- `setup.sh`: warn when `IMAGE_NAME` cannot be detected and `.env.example` not found
- `display_env.bats`: auto-skip GUI tests for headless repos
- `dockerfile/Dockerfile.test-tools`: pre-built test tools image (ShellCheck + Hadolint + Bats)
- `dockerfile/Dockerfile.example`: Dockerfile template for new repos
- `init.sh`: support creating new repo with full project structure
- `build.sh`: auto-build `test-tools:local` before compose build
- 5 new tests (137 total)

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Directory restructure
  - `build.sh`, `run.sh`, `exec.sh`, `stop.sh`, `Makefile`, `setup.sh` → `script/docker/`
  - `ci.sh` → `script/ci/`
  - `init.sh`, `upgrade.sh` → template root (user-facing)
- Other repos symlink path: `template/build.sh` → `template/script/docker/build.sh`

## [v0.4.2] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- `run.sh`: set `--name "${IMAGE_NAME}"` in foreground mode (`docker compose run`) so container name matches `container_name` in compose.yaml

### Removed
- `script/migrate.sh`: all repos migrated, no longer needed
- i18n translations for TEST.md and CHANGELOG.md (keep English only)

## [v0.4.1] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Rename `test/smoke_test/` → `test/smoke/`
- Fix README.md TOC anchor and add missing Tests section

## [v0.4.0] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- Move `config/` back to root level (was `script/config/` in v0.3.0) — configs are not scripts
- Fix `self-test.yaml` release archive: remove stale root `setup.sh` reference
- Fix mermaid architecture diagrams: `setup.sh` shown in correct `script/` box
- Add Table of Contents to zh-TW and zh-CN READMEs
- Add `Makefile.ci` entry to "What's included" table (all translations)
- Fix "Running Tests" section to use `make -f Makefile.ci` (all translations)
- Rename `test/smoke_test/` → `test/smoke/`

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-03-29

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Rename repo `docker_template` → `template`
- **BREAKING**: Move `setup.sh` → `script/setup.sh`
- **BREAKING**: Move `config/` → `script/config/` (reverted in v0.4.0)
- Apply Google Shell Style Guide to all shell scripts
- Split `Makefile` into `Makefile` (repo entry) + `Makefile.ci` (CI entry)
- Fix directory structure, test counts, bashrc style in documentation
- 132 tests (was 124)

### Migration notes
- Other repos: subtree prefix changes from `docker_template/` to `template/`
- `CONFIG_SRC` path in Dockerfile: `docker_template/config` → `template/config`
- Symlinks: `docker_template/*.sh` → `template/*.sh`

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- `script/ci.sh`: CI pipeline script (local + remote)
- `Makefile`: unified command entry
- Restructured `test/unit/` and `test/smoke_test/`
- Restructured `doc/` with i18n (readme/, test/, changelog/)
- Coverage permissions fix (chown with HOST_UID/HOST_GID)

### Changed
- `smoke_test/` moved to `test/smoke_test/` (**BREAKING**: Dockerfile COPY path change)
- `compose.yaml` calls `script/ci.sh --ci` instead of inline bash
- `self-test.yaml` calls `script/ci.sh` instead of docker compose directly

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- **Shared shell scripts**: `build.sh`, `run.sh` (with X11/Wayland support), `exec.sh`, `stop.sh`
- **setup.sh**: `.env` generator merged from `docker_setup_helper` (auto-detect UID/GID, GPU, workspace path, image name)
- **Config files**: bashrc, tmux, terminator, pip configs from `docker_setup_helper`
- **Shared smoke tests** (`smoke_test/`):
  - `script_help.bats` — 16 tests for script help/usage
  - `display_env.bats` — 10 tests for X11/Wayland environment (GUI repos)
  - `test_helper.bash` — unified bats loader
- **Template self-tests** (`test/`): 114 tests with ShellCheck + Bats + Kcov coverage
- **CI reusable workflows**:
  - `build-worker.yaml` — parameterized Docker build + smoke test
  - `release-worker.yaml` — parameterized GitHub Release
  - `self-test.yaml` — template's own CI
- **`migrate.sh`**: batch migration script for converting repos from `docker_setup_helper` to `template`
- `.hadolint.yaml`: shared Hadolint rules
- `.codecov.yaml`: coverage configuration
- Documentation: README (English), README.zh-TW.md, README.zh-CN.md, README.ja.md, TEST.md

### Changed
- `setup.sh` default `_base_path` traverses 1 level up (`/..`) instead of 2 (`/../..`) to match new `template/setup.sh` location

### Migration notes
- Replace `docker_setup_helper/` subtree with `template/` subtree
- Shell scripts at root become symlinks to `template/`
- Local `build-worker.yaml` / `release-worker.yaml` replaced by reusable workflow calls in `main.yaml`
- Dockerfile `CONFIG_SRC` path: `docker_setup_helper/src/config` → `template/config`
- Shared smoke tests loaded via `COPY template/smoke_test/` in Dockerfile (not symlinks)
